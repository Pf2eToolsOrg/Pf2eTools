While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends.

Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink.

This form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.",

You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the imprisonment occurred.
