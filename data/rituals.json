Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 Ã— the imprisonment ritual's spell level, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.",
						"{@bold Prison} You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.",
						"{@bold Slumber} (sleep effect) You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target\u2014whether romantically, filially, or otherwise\u2014frees it from the slumber. This form of imprisonment is also enchantment magic.",
						"{@bold Temporal Stasis} You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of imprisonment, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a {@spell dispel magic} or {@spell haste} spell. This form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.",
						"{@bold Object} (9th level or higher) You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.",
						"{@bold Oubliette} (10th level only) You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the imprisonment occurred. Powerful magic such as wish can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-level freedom ritual can do so."

You take the role of the director, while the secondary casters are either actors ({@skill Performance}) or significant backstage figures, such as set or costume designers ({@skill Crafting}). The casting time of the ritual includes both preparations and rehearsals of various sorts and the actual performance, which must be at least an hour long.",

This performance must be presented to an audience of at least a hundred people, a majority of whom must both be connected, at least peripherally, to the events in question (the people of the tyrant's city, or the residents of the village where the murder occurred) and who must understand what the metaphor or allegory actually refers to. For the magic to spark, the performance must declare its purpose loudly and clearly to the parties most concerned.
