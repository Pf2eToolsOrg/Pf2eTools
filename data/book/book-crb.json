						"A roleplaying game is an interactive story where one player, the Game Master (GM), sets the scene and presents challenges, while other players take the roles of player characters (PCs) and attempt to overcome those challenges. Danger comes in the form of monsters, devious traps, and the machinations of adversarial agents, but Pathfinder also provides political schemes, puzzles, interpersonal drama, and much, much more.",
						"The game is typically played in a group of four to seven players, with one of those players serving as the group's Game Master. The GM prepares, presents, and presides over the game's world and story, posing challenges and playing adversaries, allies, and bystanders alike. As each scene leads into the next, each player contributes to the story, responding to situations according to the personality and abilities of their character.",

A complete Pathfinder story can be as short as a single session, commonly referred to as a \"one-shot,\" or it can stretch on for multiple sessions, forming a campaign that might last for months or even years. If the Game Master enjoys telling the story and the players are entertained, the game can go as long as you like.",
								"A session can be mostly action, with battles with vile beasts, escapes from fiendish traps, and the completion of heroic quests. Alternatively, it could include negotiating with a baron for rights to a fort, infiltrating an army of lumbering frost giants, or bargaining with an angel for a strand of hair required for an elixir to revive a slain friend. Ultimately it's up to you and your group to determine what kind of game you are playing, from dungeon exploration to a nuanced political drama, or anything in between."

Pathfinder uses 4-sided dice (or d4), 6-sided dice (d6), 8-sided dice (d8), 10-sided dice (d10), 12-sided dice (d12), and 20-sided dice (d20). If you need to roll multiple dice, a number before the \"d\" tells you how many. For example, \"4d6\" means you should roll four dice, all 6-sided.

As the characters overcome challenges, defeat foes, and complete adventures, they amasses 1,000 XP, they go up a level, gaining new abilities so they can take on even greater challenges.

Finally, {@b Charisma} indicates charm, persuasiveness, and force of personality. Ability scores for ordinary folk range from as low as 3 to as high as 18, with 10 representing average human capabilities.

						"In a Pathfinder game, three modes of play determine the pacing of each scene in the story. Most of your character's time is spent in {@b exploration}, uncovering mysteries, solving problems, and interacting with other characters. The Age of Lost Omens abounds with danger, however, and characters often find themselves in an {@b encounter}, fighting savage beasts and terrifying monsters. Finally, time moves quickly when the characters enjoy {@b downtime}, a respite from the world's troubles and a chance to rest and train for future expeditions. Throughout an adventure, game play moves between these three modes many times, as needed for the story. The more you play the game, the more you'll see that each mode has its own play style, but moving from mode to mode has few hard boundaries.",
						"During the game, your character will face situations where the outcome is uncertain. A character might need to climb a sheer cliff, track down a wounded chimera, or sneak past a sleeping dragon, all of which are dangerous tasks with a price for failure. In such cases, the acting character (or characters) will be asked to attempt a to determine whether or not they succeed. A check is usually made by rolling a single 20-sided die (a d20) and adding a number based on the relevant ability. In such cases, rolling high is always good.",
						"Once a check is rolled, the GM compares the result to a target number called the {@b difficulty class (DC)} to determine the outcome. If the result of the check is equal to or greater than the DC, the check is successful. If it is less, the check is a failure. Beating the DC by 10 or more is referred to as a {@b critical success}, which usually grants an especially positive outcome. Similarly, failing the check by 10 or more is a {@b critical failure} (sometimes called a fumble). This sometimes results in additional negative effects. You also often score a critical success by rolling a 20 on the die when attempting a check (before adding anything). Likewise, rolling a 1 on the die when attempting a check often results in a critical failure. Note that not all checks have a special effect on a critical success or critical failure and such results should be treated just like an ordinary success or failure instead.",
						"For example, in pursuit of the wounded chimera, your character might find the path blocked by a fast-moving river. You decide to swim across, but the GM declares this a dangerous task and asks you to roll an {@skill Athletics} skill check (since swimming is covered by the {@skill Athletics} skill). On your character sheet, you see that your character has a +8 modifier for such checks. Rolling the d20, you get an 18, for a total of 26. The GM compares this to the DC (which was 16) and finds that you got a critical success (since the result exceeded the DC by 10). Your character swims quickly across the river and continues the pursuit, drenched but unharmed. Had you gotten a result less than 26 but equal to or greater than 16, your character would have made it halfway across the river. Had your result been less than 16, your character might have been swept downriver or, worse, been pulled under the current and begun to drown!",
						"Checks like this are the heart of the game and are rolled all the time, in every mode of play, to determine the outcome of tasks. While the roll of the die is critical, the statistic you add to the roll (called a {@b modifier}) often makes the difference between success and failure. Every character is made up of many such statistics governing what the character is good at, each consisting of a relevant ability modifier plus a {@b proficiency} bonus, and sometimes modified further by other factors, such as bonuses or penalties from gear, spells, feats, magic items, and other special circumstances.",
						"Proficiency is a simple way of assessing your character's general level of training and aptitude for a given task. It is broken into five different ranks: {@b untrained}, {@b trained}, {@b expert}, {@b master}, and {@b legendary}. Each rank grants a different proficiency bonus. If you're untrained at a statistic, your proficiency bonus is +0\u2014you must rely solely on the raw potential of your ability modifier. If your proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, expert, master, and legendary, your bonus equals your character's level plus another number based on the rank (2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively).

Leaving town via horseback, following the trail of a marauding orc tribe, avoiding the tribe's scouts, and convincing a local hunter to help in an upcoming fight are all examples of things that might occur during exploration.",

								"While exploration is handled in a free-form manner, encounters are more structured. The players and GM roll {@b initiative} to determine who acts in what order. The encounter occurs over a number of {@b rounds}, each of which is equal to about 6 seconds of time in the world of the game. During a round, each participant takes a {@b turn}. When it's your turn to act, you can use up to three {@b actions}. Most simple things, such as drawing a weapon, moving a short distance, opening a door, or swinging a sword, use a single action to perform.

								"If your character finds themself the target of a magical {@i lightning bolt or the freezing breath of a fearsome white} dragon, you will be called on to attempt a {@b saving throw}, representing your character's ability to avoid danger or otherwise withstand an assault to their mind or body. A saving throw is a check attempted against the DC of the spell or special ability targeting your character. There are three types of saving throws, and a character's proficiency in each says a great deal about what they can endure. A {@b Fortitude} saving throw is used when your character's health or vitality is under attack, such as from poison or disease.",
								"A {@b Reflex} saving throw is called for when your character must dodge away from danger, usually something that {@i affects a large area, such as the scorching blast of a fireball} spell. Finally, a {@b Will} saving throw is often your defense against spells and effects that target your character's mind, {@i such as a charm or confusion spell. For all saving throws,} a success lessens the harmful effect, and scoring a critical success usually means your character escapes unscathed.",
								"Attacks, spells, hazards, and special abilities frequently either deal {@b damage} to a character or impose one or more {@b conditions}\u2014and sometimes both. Damage is subtracted and when a creature is reduced to 0 HP, it falls unconscious and may die! A combat encounter typically lasts until one side has been defeated, and while this can mean retreat or surrender, it most often happens because one side is dead or dying. Conditions can hinder a creature for a time, limiting the actions they can use and applying penalties to future checks.

Lyz is playing Valeros, a daring human fighter, James is playing Merisiel, a deadly elven rogue, and Judy is taking on the role of Kyra, a fiery human cleric of Sarenrae. The group has just defeated a horde of undead and is making its way into an ancient mausoleum.",
						"{@b Erik:} The entrance to the crypt stands before you, a set of crumbling stairs leading down into darkness. A terrible smell issues forth from the doorway\u2014the stench of old, rotted flesh.",
						"{@b Lyz:} I'm not afraid of a foul stink! I draw my sword and ready my shield.",
						"{@b Judy:} The light of Sarenrae will guide us. I cast my {@i light spell on my religious symbol.}",
						"{@b Erik:} All right, a glowing radiance spills forth, illuminating the stairs. They appear to go down only about 10 feet before opening up into a chamber. Puddles of stagnant water fill the cracks between uneven stone tiles.",
						"{@b James:} I should go first to make sure it's safe. I'm going to draw my rapier and carefully go down the stairs, looking for traps as I go.",
						"{@b Erik:} Sure, but looking for traps is a secret check, so I'll roll for you. What's your Perception modifier?",
						"{@b James:} I have a +5.",
						"{@i Erik rolls a d20 behind his GM screen, {@condition hidden} from the players' view, and gets a 17 on the die for a total of 22, more than enough to find the trip wire on the third step.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Your caution pays off! You spot a thin wire located at ankle height just above the third stair.",
						"{@b James:} I point it out to the others and head down.",
						"{@b Lyz:} I follow right behind Merisiel, avoiding the wire but otherwise keeping an eye out for danger.",
						"{@b Judy:} Me too.",
						"{@b Erik:} Okay! You make it down the stairs to find yourselves in a crypt. Ancient wood coffins are arranged around the room, covered in cobwebs and dust. Directly ahead, on a raised dais, is a stone casket adorned with wicked-looking symbols. You can tell that it was once wrapped in iron chains, but now twisted links are scattered around the room, along with chunks of what must have been the casket's lid. From the damage, it looks like it was shattered from within!",
						"{@b Judy:} Sarenrae protect us. I draw my blade and advance\u2014I want a better look at those symbols.",
						"{@b Lyz:} I'll keep pace with her. I don't like the look of this.",
						"{@b James:} I think I'll stay back here and hide behind one of the coffins.",
						"{@b Erik:} Merisiel takes cover while the two of you advance. As you draw near, the stench of rot grows stronger until it's almost overpowering.",
						"Suddenly you see the source of the horrid odor.",
						"Rising up out of the casket is a nightmarish dead thing. It might have once been a human, but it's hard to tell from its withered body. Its flesh is the color of a new bruise, pulled so tight across its bones that it has split in places.",
						"It's hairless, with pointed ears, but worst of all, its mouth is lined with tiny, sharp teeth and its tongue is entirely too long.",
						"{@b Lyz:} So, not a friend?",
						"{@b Erik:} Most certainly not. It looks poised to leap at you and attack. Roll for initiative! Valeros and Kyra need to roll Perception, while Merisiel should roll {@skill Stealth}.",
						"{@i Everyone rolls for their initiative. Lyz rolls a 2 for Valeros, getting a total of 8. Judy rolls better for Kyra, getting a total of 14. James uses {@skill Stealth} for Initiative, because Merisiel was hiding at the start of the fight, and rolls a 17 for a total of 25! Erik rolls for the undead creature, getting a 12. Erik records all these totals, putting the characters in order from highest to lowest.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Looks like Merisiel gets to act first. Whatever that thing is, you're pretty sure it doesn't know you are there.",
						"{@b James:} Awesome! For my first action, I want to draw a dagger. For my second, I want to move closer.",
						"{@b Erik:} You can get to within 15 feet of it with one Stride action.",
						"{@b James:} Perfect. For my final action, I'm going to throw my dagger at it!",
						"{@i James rolls a 13 and adds 8, due to Merisiel's skill at thrown daggers, for a total of 21, but the range means he takes a \u20132 penalty for a result of 19. Erik consults his notes to learn that the monster has an AC of 18.}",
						"{@b Erik:} That's a hit! Go ahead and roll damage.",
						"{@b James:} Okay, and I get to add extra damage due to sneak attack.",
						"{@i Rogues have the ability to deal extra damage to foes that haven't acted yet in an encounter. This extra damage also applies to attacks against enemies that are distracted. James rolls 1d4 for the dagger and 1d6 for the sneak attack, and he adds 4 for Merisiel's Dexterity, getting a total of 9.}",
						"{@b Erik:} It hisses as the blade sinks into its shoulder. That looks like it hurt, but the undead thing doesn't appear to be slowing down. James, that was all three of your actions. Next up is Kyra!",

						"{@b Erik:} At first, you thought this thing might be a ghoul, which is a type of undead that feasts on the flesh of the dead, but the terrible smell reveals the truth. This thing is a ghast, a more powerful type of ghoul. You are pretty sure that its stench can make you sick and that its claws can paralyze you with a touch.",
						"{@b Judy:} This is bad. I am going to spend my last two {@i actions to cast bless. It gives anyone next to me} a +1 bonus to attack rolls.",
						"{@i Casting this spell is an activity that requires two actions to complete, and it has two components. The complex gestures needed to invoke the spell are the somatic component, and Kyra's prayers to her deity are the verbal component.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Okay! The ghast leaps from the casket straight toward Merisiel. The stench of its rotting body is absolutely horrific up close. Attempt a Fortitude save!",
						"{@i James rolls an 8, for a total of 14.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Not quite enough\u2014you gain the {@condition sickened 1} condition, which is going to give you a \u20131 penalty to most of your d20 rolls. Next, it lunges at you, trying to bite you!",
						"{@b James:} Oh no! I use my reaction to nimbly dodge out of the way.",
						"{@i Erik rolls an attack roll for the ghast, getting an 9 on the die. Looking at the monster's statistics, he adds 11 for a total of 20. Merisiel's AC is normally 19, but the Nimble Dodge feat lets her use her reaction to increase her AC by 2 against a single attack. In this case, it turns the ghast's attack into a miss.}",
						"{@b Erik:} Does a 20 hit you?",
						"{@b James:} Nope, just missed!",
						"{@b Erik:} You twist away from the ghast as its tongue leaves a slimy film on your armor. With its final action, the undead menace lashes out at you with its claw.",
						"{@i Erik rolls a second attack with the ghast, this time with its claw. Normally this attack would take a \u20135 multiple attack penalty, but since the claw has the {@trait agile} trait, the penalty is only \u20134. He rolls a 19 on the die, adds 11 for the ghoul's attack modifier and subtracts 4, for a total of 26.}",
						"{@b Erik:} You may have dodged the ghast's bite, but the thing's bony claw rakes across your face!",
						"{@i Erik knows this is a hit and rolls the ghast's claw damage,} {@b Erik:} Take 8 points of damage, and I need you to attempt a Fortitude saving throw as a numbing sensation spreads from the wound.",
						"{@i James rolls a Fortitude saving throw. He gets a 4 on the die, and after adding his bonus and the penalty from the sickened condition, it comes out to only a 9.}",
						"{@b James:} This isn't my day. I don't suppose a 9 is good enough?",
						"{@b Erik:} I am afraid not. You are {@condition paralyzed}!",
						"{@i Erik notes that Merisiel is {@condition paralyzed}, making her unable to act, but she will get a new saving throw at the end of each of her turns to shake off the effect.}",
						"{@b Erik:} A dry, creaking laugh escapes the ghast's curled lips, but that's the end of its turn. Valeros, you are the last one to act this round.",
						"{@b Lyz:} About time, too! I raise my shield and use my final two actions to make a Sudden Charge!",
						"{@i Sudden Charge is a fighter feat that lets Valeros move up to twice his Speed and attack at the end of his movement, all for only two actions.}",
						"{@b Erik:} As you draw near, the smell is horrific. Attempt a Fortitude save.",
						"{@i After rolling, Lyz gets a 19 on the Fortitude save.}",
						"{@b Erik:} You fight off the nausea from this thing's stench. Make your attack roll.",
						"{@i Lyz rolls the die and it comes up a 20.}",
						"{@b Lyz:} I got a 20! That must be a critical success!",
						"{@b Erik:} Your blade hits the vile creature right in the neck, dealing double damage!",
						"{@i Lyz rolls a 5 on her d8, then adds 4 because of Valeros's Strength modifier. Because it is a critical success, she then doubles the total.}",
						"{@b Lyz:} A mighty 18 damage! That surely had to kill it!",
						"{@b Erik:} I'm afraid not. Black ichor runs from the deep wound on its neck, but it only turns to look at you. You can see burning hatred in its eyes!",
						"{@b Lyz:} Uh-oh.",

Each mode provides a different pace and presents a different level of risk to your characters. The Game Master (GM) determines which mode works best for the story and controls the transition between them.",
				"You'll likely talk about the modes less formally during your play session, simply transitioning between exploration and encounters during the adventure, before heading to a settlement to achieve something during downtime.",
				"The most intricate of the modes is {@b encounter mode}. This is where most of the intense action takes place, and it's most often used for combat or other high-stakes situations. The GM typically switches to encounter mode by calling on the players to \"roll for initiative\" to determine the order in which all the actors take their turns during the encounter.",
				"Time is then divided into a series of rounds, each lasting roughly 6 seconds in the game world. Each round, player characters, other creatures, and sometimes even hazards or events take their turn in initiative order. At the start of a participant's turn, they gain the use of a number of actions (typically 3 in the case of PCs and other creatures) as well as a special action called a reaction. These actions, and what you do with them, are how you affect the world within an encounter. The full rules for playing in encounter mode start on page 468.",
				"In {@b exploration mode}, time is more flexible and the play more free form. In this mode, minutes, hours, or even days in the game world pass quickly in the real world, as the characters travel cross country, explore uninhabited sections of a dungeon, or roleplay during a social gathering. Often, developments during exploration lead to encounters, and the GM will switch to that mode of play until the encounter ends, before returning to exploration mode. The rules for exploration start on page 479.",
				"The third mode is {@b downtime}. During downtime, the characters are at little risk, and the passage of time is measured in days or longer. This is when you might forge a magic sword, research a new spell, or prepare for your next adventure. The rules for downtime are on page 481.",

For instance, the 3rd-level {@spell heroism} spell grants a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, {@skill Perception} checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you were under the effect of {@spell heroism} and someone cast the {@spell bless} spell, which also grants a +1 status bonus on attacks, your attack rolls would gain only a +1 status bonus, since both spells grant a +1 status bonus to those rolls, and you only take the highest status bonus.",

You can have {@b circumstance penalties {@b status penalties}, and sometimes even {@b item penalties.} Like bonuses of the same type, you take only the worst all of various penalties of a given type. However, you can apply both a bonus and a penalty of the same type on a single roll. For example, if you had a +1 status bonus from a {@spell heroism} spell but a \u20132 status penalty from the sickened condition, you'd apply them both to your roll\u2014so {@spell heroism} still helps even though you're feeling unwell.",
								"Unlike bonuses, penalties can also be {@b untyped}, in which case they won't be classified as \"circumstance,\" \"item,\" or \"status.\" Unlike other penalties, you always add all your untyped penalties together rather than simply taking the worst one. For instance, when you use attack actions, you incur a multiple attack penalty on each attack you make on your turn after the first attack, and when you attack a target that's beyond your weapon's normal range increment, you incur a range penalty on the attack.",
								"Because these are both untyped penalties, if you make multiple attacks at a faraway target, you'd apply both the multiple attack penalty and the range penalty to your roll.",

The main types of physical damage are bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. {@b Bludgeoning damage} comes from weapons and hazards that deal blunt-force trauma, like a hit from a club or being dashed against rocks. {@b Piercing damage} is dealt from stabs and punctures, whether from a dragon's fangs or the thrust of a spear. {@b Slashing damage} is delivered by a cut, be it the swing of the sword or the blow from a scythe blades trap.",

Many times, you deal energy damage by casting magic spells, and doing so is often useful against creatures that have immunities or resistances to physical damage.",

Positive energy often manifests as healing energy to living creatures but can create {@b positive damage} that withers undead bodies and disrupts and injures incorporeal undead.

								"A single session, or a \"one-shot,\" is great if your group is trying out Pathfinder or wants to play a specific short adventure. This requires a smaller time commitment but requires the GM to present the events of the game in a way that is immediately engaging, since there's less opportunity for the players to become invested in the story or setting.",

It typically takes three to four sessions for a group to level up. Since you'll probably cancel sessions on occasion, playing once a week for a year results in roughly a 14-level campaign, playing every 2 weeks for a year gives you an 8-level campaign, and playing monthly allows for a 5-level campaign. If you play only once a month, you might consider holding longer sessions and using fast advancement (page 509).",

If you run an indefinite campaign, however, avoid ongoing plots that you can't satisfactorily end if the campaign comes to a close after the next adventure. If you introduce an overwhelmingly powerful villain who's crucial to the story but can't be stopped until the player characters are 15th level, ending the campaign at 8th level will feel anticlimactic.",

When you think you're heading toward a satisfying conclusion, it's useful to check in with the other players. You might say, \"I think we have about two sessions left. Does that work for everyone?

You can, however, ask for clarification if you need it, such as \"How far back should I rewind this?\" Some groups instead make an X with their hands, say \"Let's X that out,\" or use some other method.

The damage you take from {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent damage} occurs all at once, so if something triggers when you take damage, it triggers only once; for example, if you're {@condition dying} with several types of {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent damage}, the {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent damage} increases your {@condition dying} condition only once.",

In brief, these conditions alter how many actions you regain at the start of your turn; thus, gaining the condition in the middle of your turn doesn't adjust your number of actions on that turn. If you have conflicting conditions that affect your number of actions, you choose which actions you lose. For instance, the action gained from {@spell haste} lets you only {@action Stride} or {@action Strike}, so if you need to lose one action because you're also {@condition slowed}, you might decide to lose the action from {@spell haste}, letting you keep your other actions that can be used more flexibly.",

When you can't act, you're unable to take any actions at all.

						"You can have a given condition only once at a time. If an effect would impose a condition you already have, you now have that condition for the longer of the two durations. The shorter-duration condition effectively ends, though other conditions caused by the original, shorter-duration effect might continue.",
						"For example, let's say you have been hit by a monster that drains your vitality; your wound causes you to be {@condition enfeebled 2} and {@condition flat-footed} until the end of the monster's next turn. Before the end of that creature's next turn, a trap poisons you, making you {@condition enfeebled 2} for 1 minute. In this case, the {@condition enfeebled 2} that lasts for 1 minute replaces the {@condition enfeebled 2} from the monster, so you would be {@condition enfeebled 2} for the longer duration. You would remain {@condition flat-footed}, since nothing replaced that condition, and it still lasts only until the end of the monster's next turn.",
						"Any ability that removes a condition removes it entirely, no matter what its condition value is or how many times you've been affected by it.

						{
							"type": "pf2-title",
							"name": "Redundant Conditions with Values"
						},
						"Conditions with different values are considered different conditions. If you're affected by a condition with a value multiple times, you apply only the highest value, although you might have to track both durations if one has a lower value but lasts longer. For example, if you had a {@condition slowed 2} condition that lasts 1 round and a {@condition slowed 1} condition that lasts for 6 rounds, you'd be {@condition slowed 2} for the first round, and then you'd change to {@condition slowed 1} for the remaining 5 rounds of the second effect's duration. If something reduces the condition value, it reduces it for all conditions of that name affecting you. For instance, in this example above, if something reduced your {@condition slowed} value by 1, it would reduce the first condition from the example to {@condition slowed 1} and reduce the second to {@condition slowed 0}, removing it."
