								"Scholars of magic break down the magical forces at play and their effects using three categories. The power behind magic comes from the magical {@b essences} tied to fundamental components of reality: matter, spirit, mind, and life.",
								"Spellcasters practice one of four {@b traditions} of magic: arcane, divine, occult, or primal. Each tradition’s magic arises mainly from the confluence of two of the essences, which that tradition channels far more commonly than all others: arcane commands matter and mind, divine convokes the powers of spirit and life, occult aligns spirit and mind, and primal feeds upon matter and life. Yet these borders are not as limited as they may appear, as each tradition’s adherents have picked up other spells over time, or found ways to generate effects typically associated with one essence using clever applications of another.",
								"Finally, the most narrow category are the {@b schools} of magic. Most important to wizards—many of whom specialize in one school above others—the schools classify individual spells, items, and other magical techniques. The schools are the fingers that shape the magic, the traditions the arm that directs them, and the essences the beating heart that powers their movement."
