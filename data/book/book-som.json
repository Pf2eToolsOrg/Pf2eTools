								"Scholars of magic break down the magical forces at play and their effects using three categories. The power behind magic comes from the magical {@b essences} tied to fundamental components of reality: matter, spirit, mind, and life.",
								"Spellcasters practice one of four {@b traditions} of magic: arcane, divine, occult, or primal. Each tradition's magic arises mainly from the confluence of two of the essences, which that tradition channels far more commonly than all others: arcane commands matter and mind, divine convokes the powers of spirit and life, occult aligns spirit and mind, and primal feeds upon matter and life. Yet these borders are not as limited as they may appear, as each tradition's adherents have picked up other spells over time, or found ways to generate effects typically associated with one essence using clever applications of another.",
								"Finally, the most narrow category are the {@b schools} of magic. Most important to wizards\u2014many of whom specialize in one school above others\u2014the schools classify individual spells, items, and other magical techniques. The schools are the fingers that shape the magic, the traditions the arm that directs them, and the essences the beating heart that powers their movement."

When using these sources, consider which areas a given character or institution knows how to use or is familiar with\u2014and, crucially, which ones they're unaware of. A druid who knows geomancy and druidic circles in great depth might be entirely unfamiliar with arts practiced by arcane or occult casters. Separate what you as a player or GM understand and think of fun wrinkles or misunderstandings a character might make based on their limited experience. As another example, the magical essences are crucial to magic working, but a follower of a certain tradition might only know the practical spellcraft that lets them actually use magic. They might be unaware of the deeper sources, or even consider them unnecessary to learn\u2014frivolous time wasted on esoterica when one could be studying a new spell!",

						"The {@i Pathfinder Core Rulebook} and {@i Pathfinder Advanced Player's Guide} include rules useful to the vast majority of games. Parts of Secrets of Magic aren't meant for every table. Chapter 5 in particular, with its new forms of magic, is more appropriate for certain games and circumstances than others. Some of that chapter's entries have rarities above common to more clearly indicate this. If you're running a game or want to use options like these for your character, think in advance about what their inclusion means for your game. You might even want to have a discussion about the implications with the rest of your group.",
						"That said, Chapters 2, 3, and 4 are more broadly useful. Even if you don't want to have elementalists as a specific type of caster in your game, the elemental spells in Chapter 3 could still be useful for any caster of the appropriate tradition. The classes in this book are common, as are the vast majority of spells and magic items.",

Exploring the spells and items can open up more options for the new rules in the Book of Unlimited Magic, and the new classes will find spells that work well with their abilities.

								"The Tools of Creation approach, also called Nexian Understanding, posits magic is leftover detritus from the dawn of time, when the universe was created at some indeterminate point in eternity by entities unknown. However, this was not a simple or painless thing. It required scaffolding, tools, and effort on a scale that the mortal mind is little capable of comprehending. Magic theory is discovering these tools and applying them to mortal purposes.{@sup 7} Thus, in the Tools of Creation, when one casts a 4th- Degree Incendiary, one is using the same tools that originally created our sun, albeit on an immensely smaller scale.{@sup 8}",
								"An alternative perspective proposed recently by Prof. Juleanna Foridius was that magic use actually utilizes various flaws in the structure of the universe\u2014essentially applying a chisel of mortal will to tiny chinks in the mortar of reality.{@sup 9}",
								"One key ramification of the Tools of Creation is that it posits that magic is ultimately finite, if incredibly vast. All spells that ever were or could be are integrated into the structure of the universe, and one cannot \"invent\" a new spell. One can only discover what was previously unknown. Perhaps in some unimaginably distant day, all magic will be discovered and understood.",
								"The Tools of Creation has historically been centered around the Arcanamirium in Absalom, and some believe the archmage Nex understood magic in such terms. It is most prominent in Absalom, Cheliax, Taldor, and Nex. For the moment, Prof. Foridius's variant hypothesis has been most eagerly taken up in her native Egorian.",
								"The Soil and Path approach, also called the Channeling Method, comes out of the Magaambya in Nantambu. Proponents of the Soil and Path argue that the universe has more flexibility in its physical laws than typically believed. Rather than stone, the universe is soil, and sufficient application of will and energy can command reality to overturn itself. Such power is generally outside the grasp of all except gods, magically potent creatures, or the most puissant of archmages. The act of forcing your will upon reality leaves marks, like the wheels of a wagon leave ruts in the soil. These ruts channel magical energy down precisely the same path it had taken before, and in so doing make subsequent castings of the spell easier. If the first act of wizardry is equivalent to forging your way through dense jungle, soon there is a trail, then a path, and finally a wide road, at which point any arcane spellcaster can cast the spells.{@sup 10}",
								"Unlike the Tools of Creation, the Soil and Path holds magic to be infinite and unbounded, limited only by creativity. The abiding interest of Southern wizards is in discovering how to impress spells more easily into the universe, and they perform endless experiments to try to force new magic into being. Advocates of the Soil and Path are fond of tracing their history to Old-Mage Jatembe, and the approach is quite dominant in many nations and regions in Garund.",

								"To cast a spell, wizards{@sup 63} must first create a mental construct of that spell: a task which requires a fair amount of time and effort, usually prepared at the beginning of each day for convenience. Typically, this requires the use of a mnemonic matrix\u2014there are as many of these as there are practicing wizards, but for the following example I will use the classic memory palace.{@sup 64}",
								"Imagine a great palace with ten floors. In each room, you build the construct of a spell: a combination of language and mathematics, symbolism and geometry, which defines how the spell functions in the world. On the first floor you form the simplest spells, but the ones higher up require greater complexity and stronger attachments. The tenth floor is reserved for only the greatest of archmages.{@sup 65} You then energize the spell, redirecting a minute amount of your mental essence into powering the construct.",
								"The mental spell construct is not a completed spell, but it is the potentiality of a spell, ninety-nine parts out of a hundred of a finished spell, akin to an epic poem with the last stanza missing. When the spell is called for, the wizard completes the arcane construct by providing the final elements\u2014these are called components and are typically classed into general groups: verbal, somatic, material, and focus. Simultaneously, the wizard sets the final parameters of the spell, such as the range and target of a war-spell or the visualization for an illusion. At that point, the mental construct is completed, and the energy stored within it is able to act, producing the desired physical effect, and the spell construct collapses in the process.{@sup 66}",
								"An important ramification of this collapse is that the wizard cannot swiftly recreate a mental construct\u2014they are constrained both by time and the limitations of their mental energy, the latter of which appears to be a hard limit on how much magic an arcane spellcaster can have. An apprentice wizard will have only two or three spells, while an experienced wizard might have fifteen or twenty at hand. But even archmages such as Sorshen or Tar-Baphon have a finite supply of complex magic at their beck and call at any time.",
								"For the purposes of instruction, spells are classed by school (evocation, illusion, divination, and so on), by degree and category if needed (4th-Level incendiary), and by specific spell manifestation (such as fireball, invisibility, clairvoyance). Common names popular in certain regions or coteries (\"invocation of the blinded eye,\" \"Al-Mirai's telesight\") are best avoided in instruction, as they are functionally identical for most purposes. However, they may have cosmetic differences or varying inputs and learning them might be necessary to communicate with certain groups. I've done my utmost to eliminate such colloquialisms from the Acadamae's instruction to get as close to the essentials as possible."

								"63. Practitioners of other arts such as sorcery and witchcraft have their own methods\u2014these are similar to but distinct from wizardry and will be discussed in later chapters.",
								"64. Uldor, Oridius, {@i The Art of Remembrance} (Arcanamirium, 4519)",
								"65. Why ten floors? Difficult to say, but experimental data clearly show that spells can be sorted into ten bands of power and complexity, aside from simple cantrips. The general consensus is that this reflects something fundamental in the mathematics of our reality, though iconoclastic scholars such as Prof. Foridius argue that it reflects nothing more than an artifact of our base-ten counting system.",
								"66. The spells commonly called cantrips are the exception to this rule. Cantrips are extremely simple, robust spell constructs that do not collapse when used, instead refilling their energy reservoirs automatically. A wizard can prepare only so many cantrips at a time, but they are endlessly reusable."
