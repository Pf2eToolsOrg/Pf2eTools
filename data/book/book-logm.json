				"A defining characteristic of fantasy as a genre is the presence and use of magic\u2014a fantasy roleplaying game without magic would be like a science fiction story without technology or a horror story without fear! Pathfinder posits four traditions of magic: arcane, divine, occult, and primal. For a faithful character, divine magic is usually the most intrinsically appealing, as it reflects a direct connection to a deity.",
				"Divine magic is the intersection of the instinctual and faith-based vital essence that rules over life and death, and the otherworldly spiritual essence that forms the building blocks of all souls. It can close wounds in seconds, call down blasts of divine vengeance, uncover hidden truths, reveal the future, and even temporarily turn a devotee into an avatar of their god. The idea of divine might invokes images of a righteous crusader, but neutral and evil gods similarly imbue their devotees with power to further their own causes. The divine tradition also encompasses spiritual philosophies that don't involve any specific deity, as well as pantheons of multiple deities.",
				"This book presents an in-depth look at the gods presented in {@book Chapter 8|CRB|8|Religion} of the {@i Pathfinder Core Rulebook}, including alternate domains and divine intercessions each god grants. Following that are 20 additional gods, with rules for playing their clerics and champions, including how to assume the forms of their mighty avatars. Following these entries, this book describes demigod pantheons, such as the Eldest and the empyreal lords, as well as spiritual philosophies, including the {@deity Green Faith} and {@deity Sangpotshi|LOGM}. This book also includes exciting new domains, feats, items, spells, and weapons useful for many characters, not just {@class cleric||clerics}.",

						"Faith is important in any fantasy world where mortals can wield divine power. On Golarion, the existence of the gods is not a speculative question. To the contrary, the veracity of each of the gods is demonstrable, visible through manifestations ranging from powerful divine spells to portentous curses and boons.",
						"Belief and devotion shape life on Golarion in numerous ways. Generally, the gods imbue their most devoted followers with their magic. A {@class cleric||cleric's} adherence to the principles and observances of their god underpins their ability to access the divine magic that powers their spells. A {@class champion} forges their very identity in devotion to their deity and cause, from which they draw their righteous zeal. Other mortals often view with awe those characters commanding divine power through such intense piety.",
						"Yet these are exceptional cases, and more mundane faith is common. A {@class fighter} might worship {@deity Kurgess|LOGM}, the god of healthy competition and physical development, while a {@class barbarian} similarly follows {@deity Gorum}, the god of strength and battle, each finding inspiration for their personal growth and values in their worship. Wilderness-roaming characters, such as {@class ranger||rangers} and {@class druid||druids} (whose magic derives from primal forces rather than the divine), may feel drawn to the {@deity Green Faith} or {@deity Shoanti animism|LOGM} as an expression of their connection to the earth\u2014or they might venerate {@deity Gozreh}, the god of nature; {@deity Sarenrae}, the goddess of the sun; or {@deity Tsukiyo|LOGM}, the god of the moon. Scholarly characters, such as {@class alchemist||alchemists} and {@class wizard||wizards}, may recognize that religious devotions provide them with a connection to community, a sense of purpose, or even a path to greater personal power. They might worship a deity associated with intellectual pursuits, like the god of magic, {@deity Nethys}, or they might enjoy established and well-connected churches, such as those of {@deity Abadar}, the god of cities and wealth; {@deity Iomedae}, the goddess of justice and honor; or {@deity Asmodeus}, the god of tyranny and pride. {@class sorcerer||Sorcerers} and {@class bard||bards}, on the other hand, might be inspired to worship {@deity Shelyn}, the goddess of art and love; {@deity Desna}, the goddess of luck and travel; or even {@deity Cayden Cailean}, the god of freedom and alcohol. Devotion might be woven into their self-expression, or it could provide a connection to like-minded followers, or give them a deeper sense of purpose. Characters who rely on perfecting their skills, such as {@class rogue||rogues} and {@class monk||monks}, might be drawn to the worship of {@deity Irori}, the god of knowledge and self-perfection\u2014or of {@deity Norgorber}, the god of secret knowledge and thievery.",
						"While most characters faithful enough to gain power from their deity do so in service to a single god or goddess, most people on Golarion venerate many deities, giving praise or asking for aid based on the circumstances of their lives. The focus of a person's faith may change as circumstances do. A {@class barbarian} might have a central devotion to {@deity Chaldira|LOGM}, the halfling god of battle and luck, but add prayers to {@deity Shelyn}, god of beauty and love, when she finds true love. Upon the untimely death of her lover, she may turn to {@deity Pharasma}, god of death and fate, or to {@deity Desna}, god of dreams, to ease her grief\u2014or to {@deity Calistria}, god of vengeance, to repay the death. Similarly, a dishonored politician might continue to honor {@deity Gruhastha|LOGM} the Keeper but offer a prayer to {@deity Achaekek|LOGM}, the mantis god of assassins and death, to regain her power."

						"As befits a reality in which gods and magic are demonstrable, the deities of the Pathfinder setting are not aloof constructs whose power merely provides options for character creation. They are deeply involved in the fabric of reality, shaping the course of Golarion's people in particular. Ascension to godhood is a real and living thing on Golarion; deities including {@deity Arazni|LOGM}, {@deity Cayden Cailean}, {@deity Iomedae}, {@deity Norgorber}, and most recently {@deity Casandalee|LOGM} were mortals on Golarion who ascended to become deities. Others, such as {@deity Abadar} and {@deity Sarenrae}, have their homes in other planes and predate Golarion's existence, yet they nevertheless take an active interest in its workings.",
						"Political upheavals can favor particular gods, and some show deities' direct influence. Cheliax's pact with {@deity Asmodeus} has inarguably extended his diabolical influence across the Inner Sea region. The success of the undead nation of Geb is a boon to {@deity Urgathoa}, while simultaneously offering endless worry to {@deity Pharasma} and her legions of psychopomps. The destruction of Lastwall was a blow to {@deity Iomedae}, greatly reducing her influence in that region. While these gods also have myriad extraplanar and extra-worldly concerns beyond mortal consideration, they are still\u2014to varying degrees and at various times\u2014deeply invested in the dramas playing out across Golarion, and they manifest their will accordingly.",
						"Despite a long and deep divine connection to Golarion, it is extremely rare for a god to appear in the world. The gift of divine power is the most common way in which the gods influence mortal (as well as undead and immortal) lives on the planet. Divine intercession, through the granting of boons and curses, is another way in which the gods spread their influence. Golarion's deities don't spend the majority of their time doling out curses and boons, nor does every god pay attention to every mortal\u2014no god has that much time amid their plots and alliances playing out on an extraplanar scale. Yet when their attention is attracted through particular merit or outrage, or when it fits into a larger objective, they may intercede to bless or to curse a mortal who has drawn their attention. Finally, a god might speak to a mortal through a dream, portent, or singular religious experience. Such moments can shape a character's deepest values and motives, and they are entirely at the GM's discretion.",
						"Campaigns set on worlds other than Golarion can still use the rules and information found in this book to deepen religious themes. The gods exert their influence across the multiverse, and they might enact dramas similar to those described here on any world of the GM's creation. Alternatively, different gods might take the center stage in another world's pantheon, or they might have entirely different relationships. On a different world, {@deity Rovagug} might be the primary deity and principal villain behind truly monstrous schemes, and {@deity Nethys}\u2014in his role as a destroyer\u2014might support the Rough Beast."

								"{@action Retraining} requires substantial downtime\u2014in most cases, at least a month. A character who wishes to {@action retraining||retrain} into a different faith with similar concerns and domains requires less time to convert than a character moving into a radically divergent faith. Thus, a {@class cleric} of {@deity Grandmother Spider|LOGM} might move to the worship of {@deity Calistria} with a month's tutelage and service in one of her temples. However, that same {@class cleric} of {@deity Grandmother Spider|LOGM} could not so easily become a priest of {@deity Asmodeus}, even though both deities share the trickery domain\u2014their longstanding animosity is reflected in their diametrically opposed doctrines and cultures. Such a conversion is not impossible but could take several months of downtime or happen piecemeal over months of in-game development. In some instances, particularly in the case of PCs or other high-profile targets of conversion, a new deity might send an emissary directly to a character struggling with a crisis of faith in order to tempt that character to righteousness or villainy. In these cases, the emissary might be able to offer a near-immediate transformation as an enticement, funneling vital and spiritual essence primed to the deity's philosophy into the converting character to remove the need for any downtime at all. Such a transformation is not without risks, however, and may come with complications down the line.",
								"At the GM's discretion, characters for whom divine patronage is essential but who lose faith completely can {@action retraining||retrain} into a new class. A {@class champion} might retrain as a {@class fighter} or a {@class ranger}, swapping out faith-based feats and class features for appropriate analogues. The length of downtime required in any of these cases is at the GM's discretion, though the player and GM are advised to work together to determine a suitable time frame that does not fully interrupt play and can help tell a satisfying story."

								"To make their influence on Golarion felt directly\u2014but without manifesting on the planet in all their divine glory\u2014each god has the tool of divine intercession. Divine intercession manifests as a boon or a curse, of varying duration and power, visited upon a mortal. Curses are not triggered simply by doing something a god does not like, or everyone in Golarion would be cursed all the time; they are often reserved for followers of the god who commit anathema that aren't strong enough to warrant ejection from the faith, or those who have committed shocking blasphemies. Conversely, an unaffiliated worshipper embroiled in high-profile actions that are anathema to a god could earn a curse. Similarly, boons are not automatically granted to anyone petitioning the god. Certainly, someone who upholds a deity's edicts could earn a boon, especially when acting under adverse circumstances. Most often, as befits their inscrutable nature, a deity will bestow a boon or a curse for their own reasons. Perhaps a mission is of dire importance to a god's plan for a specific place or people, or perhaps the survival of a particular character figures in their plans decades from now.",
								"The divine intercessions provided in each entry are examples, and the GM can have any deity grant a different effect than the intercessions provided. These intercessions are special and are always at the deity's, and thus the GM's, direct discretion, with the GM deciding when a boon or curse goes into effect. The GM is also at liberty to remove a boon or curse as is appropriate for the game's story. A PC or NPC can never select a feat, spell, or other rules option that entitles them to a divine boon or bestows a divine curse upon foes. Minor intercessions are memorable for the recipient, providing either a relatively modest and long-lasting effect or a spectacular but fleeting one. Moderate intercessions are hugely significant events that typically come with permanent consequences, and major intercessions can pivotally reshape a recipient's life, granting powers wildly beyond their innate abilities or inflicting life-changing curses.",

											"source": "LOGMWS",
											"page": 2,
											"entries": [
												"The intercessions presented in {@i Lost Omens Gods & Magic} and in this document provide intercessions for the featured deities of the Inner Sea region. However, the people of Golarion worship countless deities, including those that may not already have intercessions listed. If you wish to create new intercessions for these other deities or even new deities of your own design, here are a few suggestions.",
												"{@b Balance:} Deities are all-powerful beings in the Age of Lost Omens, capable of feats far beyond those that any PC or NPC could ever achieve. However, even with this unlimited power and potential, deities tend to only use a fraction of their abilities to help or hinder mortals. A good guideline to determine the power and capability of a boon or curse is to look at the effects of spells and rituals. Minor effects should be on par with a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell or ritual. Use 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-level spells and rituals as a guideline for moderate effects. Major effects should probably be equivalent to a 7th-, 8th-, or 9th-level spell or ritual.",
												"The effects of intercessions tend to be instantaneous or last a single combat at most. As these effects aren't spells, feel free to be a bit more liberal with the power of the effects, however. For example, an intercession that {@condition quickened||quickens} a creature but grants the creature 2 additional actions instead of 1 is more powerful than a standard {@spell haste} spell, but would probably still serve well as a moderate boon. Any effects that last much longer should probably remain closer to the power of a spell or ritual. Deities can be fickle, though, so feel free to enhance, reduce, or outright remove any effect that isn't working how you would like.",
												"{@b Frequency:} Repeated use of divine intercessions will quickly cause them to lose their luster. Deities tend to avoid interceding for the most part and will only do so on rare occasions. If PCs started receiving boons with every prayer, the intercessions would eventually lose what makes them unique and become just another \"buff\" that the PCs use in their everyday adventures. Try to keep intercessions restricted to key moments of drama or as rewards for significant events in your campaign.",
												"In addition, try to avoid keeping long-lasting intercessions in effect for too long. A PC that earns a boon might only keep it until their deity's will is done, such as after the slaying of a significant enemy. A cursed PC could lose their curse after a genuine attempt to atone and seek forgiveness for their misdeeds against a deity. Typically, one level's worth of adventuring or a significant story milestone is a good place to remove the effects of an intercession. Allowing a PC to keep the effects of an intercession for longer has effects on the overall balance of play, either in or against the PC's favor. However, in the end, your group can decide what's best. A group of divinely mandated characters each with a unique boon from their respective deity can make for a truly exciting and heroic game!",
												"{@b Theme:} Most important of all is that any new intercession matches the theme of the deity who grants it. In some cases, a thematic and flavorful intercession is more interesting than a simple numerical bonus. For example, {@deity iomedae||Iomedae's} minor boon allows a PC to remain clean and tidy at all times, regardless of what events they undergo. This has no mechanical effect but ties into {@deity iomedae||Iomedae's} themes of purity and valor. Minor boons are a great place for effects such as these. Rather than granting a bonus to Diplomacy checks, consider having the boon allow a PC to be heard by anyone who can see them, enabling them to influence others at a distance.",
												"Beyond making these unique abilities, you can always choose to provide existing effects that are thematic. A storm deity might grant the ability to cast {@spell chain lightning} as an innate spell. Beyond that, you can also restrict specific effects to their more thematic elements. The same storm deity could grant {@spell elemental form}, but restrict the form to only that of an air elemental. Finally, feel free to tweak the flavor or effects of a spell or ritual to better match the associated deity. The storm deity could grant {@spell fireball} but have it become a spell named {@i thunderclap}, using the original spell's mechanics but changing the damage type from fire to sonic. Tweaking existing effects in this way can help you create new intercessions with relatively little work, especially in cases where you feel an intercession is needed on short notice."

Regardless of their origin or true nature, the term has expanded over time to include any of the myriad of powerful entities from the Great Beyond who take an interest in Golarion and answer the prayers of their followers, from divine entities who truly went through a sort of ascension to exemplars of already powerful types of outsiders.",
				"The following pages describe many of the demigods whose followers can be found in the Inner Sea region. Many more demigods exist than are detailed here, including ones whose worship is common in other parts of Golarion, demigods who have ascended from obscure types of planar beings rarely encountered on Golarion, beings of lesser power with very limited presences in Golarion, and those that have fully devoted their attentions to other planes altogether. Additionally, the ranks of the demigods are constantly changing as their jockeying for power\u2014their alliances, betrayals, and competitions with one another\u2014and the distant but ever-present possibility of true apotheosis lead to realignments, declines in stature, and occasional deaths that reverberate through the fabric of the Great Beyond.",
				"The entries that follow provide details on these demigods and Outer Gods, and statistics for their worship can be found in the tables on pages 124\u2013133.",

At the GM's discretion, {@class champion||champions} and {@class cleric||clerics} can dedicate themselves to a pantheon. In such cases, the characters still worship a specific patron deity among those in the pantheon, but also follow the edicts and anathema of the pantheon as a whole. A character who worships a pantheon this way can gain the domains, alternate domains, and spells from the pantheon instead of those from their patron deity. They must uphold the ideals of both their patron deity and the pantheon, though the patron deity's edicts and anathema take precedence. For example, a worshipper of {@deity Iomedae} could worship {@deity the Godclaw|LOGM}, but they wouldn't take the tyranny domain, as it would be in conflict with {@deity iomedae||Iomedae's} edicts. In rare cases, a character can worship a pantheon without following a patron deity. Such cases are unique and subject to GM approval.",

Priests of {@deity Brigh|LOGM} might develop the formula for a revolutionary magic item available to the faithful, but that doesn't mean they won't ever trade it in exchange for information about another creator's inventions. Similarly, priests of {@deity Nalinivati|LOGM} certainly aren't the only warriors who wield {@item urumi|LOGM|urumis}, but they are in part responsible for the popularity of the weapon across the Inner Sea region, and the {@item polytool|LOGM} is only one of numerous innovations emerging from Numeria.",

If so, you and the GM might work together to alter certain aspects of a feat, spell, item, or other option to ensure it fits your faith and makes sense within the larger story you want to tell.",
