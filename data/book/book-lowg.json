Perhaps you're a daring priest from the burning deserts of Qadira, blasting manticores and genies with the blazing light of the sun goddess Sarenrae, or a troll-hunting warrior from the icy Lands of the Linnorm Kings.

								"Millennia ago, the mighty Razatlan Empire spread across this vast continent, gobbling up weaker nations and marking its victories with vast pyramids. When the devastation of a meteor impact shattered the Razatlani civilization, the nations that were reborn from the wreckage found themselves forced to cooperate with each other to survive. Arcadia's myriad cultures have remained surprisingly peaceful and insular ever since, focusing their energy on the wellbeing of their citizens. From the engineers in the Land of Northern Lakes, who craft clever machines from unusually abundant skymetal deposits, to the hero-gods of Xopatl and the distant south, Arcadia's peoples both embrace a settled lifestyle among their terraced mountaintops and bayou stilt-houses and expand westward across the vast plains of a still lightly populated region. Most Arcadians remain suspicious of foreign cultures that are inclined toward conquest. Eager colonists from Avistan are thus restricted to a narrow strip of shoreline along the Grinding Coast, cordoned there by the Segada Protocol, which allows only those few exceptional individuals who have won the locals' trust to pass beyond the shielding mountains into the continent's interior."

In the north, danger\u2014and opportunity\u2014waits for adventurers over every hill in orc-ruled Belkzen and the demon-ravaged landscape of the Sarkoris Scar. The north's established nations are only marginally safer, from the rugged wilderness of Varisia and witch-ruled Irrisen to the shadowed moors of gothic Ustalav and sadistic Nidal. Avistan also has the distinction of being the center of several nonhuman cultures in the Inner Sea region, as dwarves attempt to reforge their lost empire in the Five Kings Mountains and elves guard the reclaimed lands in forested Kyonin that have been their stronghold since their return to Golarion after the Age of Darkness."

Its tunnels are inhabited by isolated tribes of xulgaths, deros, duergar, calignis, and other surface creatures who descended into the dark for safety and found themselves twisted by isolation and dark energies.

						"Thousands of years after Earthfall tore a rift across continents to form the Inner Sea, the legendary hero Aroden emerged from the darkness of history to claim his divine destiny. Using arcane power gathered over millennia, the last survivor of Old Azlant raised an otherworldly crystal, the heart of the weapon that slew his homeland, from the depths of the Inner Sea. Aroden's interaction with this alien gem, the Starstone, tested his character, and he emerged from the experience a living god. Immediately thereafter, he lifted the whole of the Isle of Kortos from the ocean depths and founded the settlement of Absalom at the site of his apotheosis to serve as the gathering point of his growing cult. He named the island Kortos\u2014\"Starstone\" in the ancient Azlanti tongue. Nearly 5,000 years later, despite the death of the god who founded it, this settlement has grown to become one of the largest metropolises on Golarion, known to many as the City at the Center of the World.",

Pilgrims came to Absalom from Osirion, Qadira, Taldor, and beyond to honor the city's mighty god-king, marvel at his seemingly impossible accomplishments, and strive to accomplish fantastic deeds of their own, many founding orders and institutions of esoteric learning that continue to the modern day.",
						"The swiftly growing riches of Absalom\u2014and the priceless jewel at its heart\u2014drew more than just pilgrims in those early days. Lured by far-flung tales of Aroden's ascension via the Starstone, the minotaur warlord Voradni Voon, conqueror of central Casmaron, plotted to wrest the stone from humanity's god and take his own place among the deities. Voon constructed the massive Brazen Gate upon the great eastern plateau of Kortos, and through it marched his horde of minotaurs, harpies, and centaurs from the distant land of Iblydos to Kortos, and thence to Absalom. Voon's attack, later remembered as the First Siege of Absalom, reached all the way to the walls of Azlanti Keep before being turned back by Aroden himself. The Last Azlanti pushed Voon and his army back to the plateau, wracking it with a series of powerful earthquakes that shattered the Brazen Gate and scattered the minotaur's forces. Voon's assault was but the first, however; would-be conquerors have besieged Absalom more than 100 times in the 5 millennia since the First Siege. Yet the city has never fallen.",
						"Not every would-be god came to Absalom with an army at their back. Over the years, at least three humans\u2014Norgorber (1893 AR), Cayden Cailean (2765 AR), and Iomedae (3832 AR\u2014used more subtle means to gain access to the Starstone Cathedral and use it to ascend to godhood. Their followings, as well as those cults dedicated to countless hopefuls who weren't so successful, added to Absalom's growing religious communities, with new temples attempting to make converts among the city's assembled religious truthseekers and fanatics.",
						"The Whispering Tyrant Tar-Baphon, an old foe of Aroden, is Absalom's most recent would-be conqueror, having launched a surprise attack on the city just 2 months ago in a bold assault that drew parallels to the initial siege of Voradni Voon. Adventuring heroes came to Absalom's defense, as they had so many times in the past, to defeat the lich-lord and send him back to the Isle of Terror. Absalomians are certain that the Tyrant will return again in the coming years with an even greater force of undead horrors, however. The only question is how many would-be conquerors will show up outside Absalom's walls between now and then."

The death of Aroden weakened the tower's magic, however, and now the harvested trees replenish at the normal rate\u2014perhaps even slower\u2014and the lumber barons of the Kortos Consortium look to druids in hopes of restoring the forest to its previous glory. The central Immenwood is older and craggier than the outskirts, prone to tangled undergrowth, an intertwined canopy, and long shadows. The forest's eastern reach touches the Tyrant's Grasp, where blighted trees grow warped and twisted by the necromantic corruption left by Tar-Baphon's defeat, and the clearings are haunted by undead wretches and sinister cultists of the Whispering Way.",
								"The Immenwood hides many ruins and lost settlements, along with several active fortresses. The wooded foothills of the Kortos Mounts hold mines, both active and inactive, almost all of which have inhabitants of one kind or another. Patrols of the First Guard's Eagle Garrison range the trails connecting the forest's settlements, which often fall prey to outlaws. The centaur tribes that dwell in the forest are more hospitable than their violent, xenophobic cousins of the Scrape, but they've suffered terribly at the hands of Absalom in recent years, and tensions remain high."

The plateau thundered with the hooves of 10,000 centaurs, whole tribes surging in vast interlocking circles to unleash a terrible earthquake upon Absalom, just as they had brought upheaval to so many of the ancient cities of Casmaron. Aroden reversed their seismic magic back upon them, killing Voradni Voon and shattering the Brazen Arch into a dozen jagged fragments. Countless centaurs toppled into deep rifts as the landscape cracked and seethed in violent destruction. After the rending of the Brazen Arch, the devastated eastern plateau became known as the Scrape. Most of the surviving minotaurs fled into the Riven Hills, where they harry Absalom and its allies to this day from their settlement at Hazrak. Voon's feral harpies, the last to give up the fight, fled to the highlands of the Kortos Mounts, and they have grown no more hospitable over the centuries."

When in port, sailors mix in Escadar's numerous barracks, saloons, gambling dens, and drug parlors.

A fall-fattened bear who appeared before hunters on the brink of starvation and a loyal war dog who saved a clan chief in battle might equally become honored huzuris after death. Once consecrated by the tribe's oldest witch, the huzuri became integral to the tribe's ancestor-based magic, and was often believed to be the repository in which the spirit of the tribe itself lived. Each successive witch and chief, upon attaining that title, pressed a fingertip soaked in their own blood to the bare skull. That crimson fingerprint stored its maker's memories, and so the collective history of the tribe was recorded in spirit-magic, blood, and bone.

Arable farmland in the region is limited to southern Brevoy, parts of the Sellen River basin scattered across Razmiran and the River Kingdoms, and tiny pockets in Mendev and Numeria.

For decades, southern nations sent soldiers and supplies northward to bolster the crusade's defenses, but when the Worldwound closed and new threats arose closer to home, those nations pulled their support away.

Yet the old enmities between Issia and Rostland, which had been held in check only by force, never healed.

Thus the legal and cultural borders between Issia and Rostland survived, and when every member of House Rogarvia vanished in a single night without a trace, Brevoy's noble families swiftly fell back into their feuds. Today, 20 years after the Vanishing, Brevoy remains on the brink of civil war despite diplomats' heroic efforts to mend the country's fractures.",

Yet while the rich farmlands of Rostland produce most of the nation's goods, Issia's sailors control shipping and pocket most of the profits. Rostlanders, who have long believed their labor is exploited by the sly, clever-tongued Issians\u2014who are, after all, outright pirates before they were conquered by Choral\u2014grow increasingly frustrated by this perceived unfairness. Issia's merchant princes argue that they supply the ships and negotiate the trade agreements that bring wealth to all, and if they can't invest adequately in their shipping fleets, they risk losing trade to foreign rivals. Meanwhile, commoners' discontent and complaints about their taxes being \"stolen\" by Issia echoes ever-louder in their lords' halls.",

As Lander had been plagued with rumors of revolutionary sentiments since his youth, many nobles in Brevoy consider this to be simply one more way the lord has embarrassed his house, but the details of his supposed treason are muddled and contradictory. House Orlovsky in particular is adamant that the accusations are foul play on the part of the Surtovas, and the strain between the two houses, already pushed to the breaking point, has boiled over past the point of reason.",

						"For well over a century, the defining fact of life in the crusader kingdom of Mendev was the Worldwound: a reality-warping Abyssal rift west of the realm that threatened to consume all of Golarion. Heroes from across Avistan and beyond answered the call to meet the demonic horde. As the years rolled into decades, however, and the hope of victory grew ever fainter, the once-bright crusade began to tarnish. Infiltrated by fiendish agents sowing treachery and paranoia, the crusade's inquisitors turned their tools against indigenous Mendevians, whose animist religions seemed suspect to the crusaders. On the front lines, the steady toll of battle forced commanders to accept recruits who were more often than not criminals and exiles driven by desperation rather than conviction.",

Seemingly overnight, the demonic host collapsed into disarray, Queen Galfrey's army swept forward, and the Fifth Mendevian Crusade declared victory.",

In their absence, the fledgling civilian government is hard-pressed to meet the nation's needs. Chancellor Irahai, appointed by the queen before her abdication, is a wise and clever governor, but hobbled by the widespread belief that her authority holds less weight in comparison to her predecessor.",

The end of the crusade has also meant an end to the money and labor that outside faiths and nations sent north to stave off the demonic threat, leaving Mendev with only its own war-depleted resources to draw upon.",
						"In addition to these difficulties, Mendev still contends with supernatural menaces. The sealing of the Worldwound did not eliminate the demons already on Golarion, and Mendev remains crucial as a staging ground for holy champions who have pledged to fight until the last fiend has been driven out. The frost-antlered shades of the Estrovian Forest and the cursed ruins of Icerift Castle, ignored during the war, remain threats as well.",
						"Yet this cold and perilous land holds wonder, too. Mendev's immense forests, white-crowned mountains, and snow-swept steppes are starkly beautiful. Scattered among them are the bones and dreams of dead generations, some who tried to tame an unyielding land and some who sought escape from the horrors of a seemingly endless war. All of them, and all their treasures, have vanished under snow and trees\u2014but not all are forgotten. Today, Kellids from the tribes of lost Sarkoris are returning to reclaim their devastated homeland. Some crusaders, hoping to atone for the cruelties inflicted by overzealous fanatics in the past, have sworn to help them. Knowing this, the surviving demons have taken to hiding their own soul-poisoning magics as relics of indigenous Sarkorian faith, as most outlanders cannot distinguish true relics from false ones."

						"Toward the end of the Age of Darkness, a great fireball with a smoking heart of steel broke apart in the night skies above Numeria, shattering into fragments\u2014some as small as fists, others large as cities\u2014that buried themselves across the rocky plains. These strange relics from another world beyond the stars have shaped life for the grim, survivalist tribes of Numeria ever since. Invisible emanations mutate the native animal and plant life into warped forms; horrors slumbering in cold chambers meant to voyage between the stars sometimes awaken and escape. Vast swaths of Numeria are cratered, irradiated wastelands populated by metal- clawed monsters with eyes of burning light. But skymetal and fragments of technology are powerful resources, and the lure of such wealth draws the brave and foolish alike.",
						"The native people of Numeria are hard-bitten Kellids, mostly hunters and herders with a dark, superstitious worldview shaped by their unforgiving land and its star-flung hazards. The fiercest warlord in each generation traditionally takes the title of the Black Sovereign and claims rulership of Numeria, but in practice most tribes have their own leaders and pay little heed to a far-off sovereign, believing only peasants and soft city folk bow their heads to such claims.",
						"This is particularly true for the current Black Sovereign, a once-mighty warrior named Kevoth-Kul, who conquered the city of Starfall in his youth. Some believed Kevoth-Kul would lead Numeria to glory on a red tide of conquest. Instead, he succumbed to the influence of the Technic League, a cabal of secretive arcanists and researchers obsessed with unlocking the secrets of Numerian technology. The Technic League plied Kevoth-Kul with the mind-altering fluids that seeped from the walls of Silver Mount, the vast and unimaginably complex edifice of alien technology half-buried in the earth outside Starfall. Soon the Black Sovereign was hopelessly addicted to these fluids, and lapsed into erratic, moody indolence.",
						"Recently, however, the Captain of the Technic League died under closely concealed circumstances. Brave souls whisper tales of a strange new goddess arising from the core of Silver Mount following the captain's demise, but the truth of these rumors is unknown. What is certain is that the Technic League fell into squabbling, murderous disarray within weeks. The survivors largely fled Starfall, and the Black Sovereign, freed from their control, has begun to break fitfully free from his addiction. Many fear that if he regains his senses, Kevoth-Kul will resume his campaign of conquest across Numeria. Since most Numerians have grown accustomed to semi-independence and no longer trust their tyrannical, unstable ruler, this is not a welcome prospect.",
						"The alternative, however, may be worse. While the Black Sovereign remained lost in his decades-long haze of intoxication, other warlords began claiming their own territories in Numeria. The collapse of the Technic League has greatly increased these warlords' power, as many former League members sought positions as advisors, and those new allies brought along their arsenals of stolen technology. Now, the warlords and their Technic League advisors are locked in an all-out arms race, each one vying to hoard the most powerful technology. While this has ensured that Numerian technology remains jealously guarded within the nation and does not reach neighboring lands, it also raises the risk that Numeria's civil war, if it comes, will prove devastating."

						"The oppressive theocracy of Razmiran, ruled by the masked priests of a masked god, has long been viewed with wariness by its neighbors. A young nation, Razmiran was carved out of the neighboring River Kingdoms only a little over 50 years ago. Yet unlike most of the short-lived countries that rise and fall in that tumultuous region, Razmiran seems grimly stable\u2014for it, unlike the kingdoms claimed by mere mortal lords, is ruled by a living god.",
						"Few have seen the living god, but Razmir's presence in his kingdom is inescapable. His masked priests maintain tight control over society, acting as enforcers more than spiritual guides. Their distinctive temples, which are always centered around a massive set of stone steps leading up to a gold or silver mask, stand in every village and market square. These steps represent the 31 steps Razmir is said to have undertaken to pass the Test of the Starstone and attain divinity, and they are a recurring motif in both theocratic rhetoric and the physical layout of Razmiran's public spaces.",
						"At present, Razmir's people take some solace in the constant reminders that they are personally protected by a deity. Soon after Tar-Baphon's resurgence and the destruction of Lastwall, Razmiran signaled that it would not oppose the Whispering Tyrant so long as the lich did not disturb the living god or his domain. This bargain appears to have been satisfactory to both parties, and thus Razmiran, alone among the nations bordering Lake Encarthan, appears poised to remain neutral in the coming conflict between Tar-Baphon and the other regional powers.",
						"Yet there are hints that this peace has been purchased at a ghastlier price than the priests acknowledge. Rumors persist that Razmiran is \"donating\" its dead to the Whispering Tyrant's armies in exchange for safety from the undead horde. These claims remain unconfirmed, in part because taboos concerning the uncleanliness of the dead are so strong in Razmiran that bodies are seldom viewed by family before being consigned to communal mausoleums, and in part because many of the dead are said to come from the massive prison mines of the Forgotten Track, where the condemned have disappeared quietly for years. Those who repeat these rumors often wonder, however, what might happen when Razmiran\u2014never an overly populous country\u2014runs out of corpses.",
						"Perhaps even more troubling are the cautious whispers from those near the clergy that Razmir himself has begun to act erratically, becoming oddly withdrawn from his priests. With the Whispering Tyrant a terrifying new threat in the region, this lapse in Razmir's attentions\u2014and perhaps his protection\u2014frightens his faithful. As of yet, however, this fear remains relatively unknown outside the most secretive circles in the capital city of Thronestep and the remote, sacred fortress of First Step.",
						"So far, everyday life in Razmiran has not drastically changed. The poor remain grindingly downtrodden, taxed nearly to starvation, while Razmir's clergy feast and indulge in every vice. In the wild Exalted Wood and the bustling crossroads town of Pilgrimage, outlaws and apostates dream of breaking the masked god's rule. That realizing these dreams may prove far more dangerous thanks to Tar-Baphon's rise does not dissuade them, for those crushed by tyranny are rarely able to see farther than the boot on their necks."

Now that the rip between worlds has been sealed and the demon lord Deskari slain, the scattered descendants of Sarkoris dare to dream of reclaiming their ancestral land, though the task that looms before them is forbidding.",
						"Despite Deskari's death and the scattering of his host, the northlands remain fraught with threats. Although the sealing of the Worldwound cut off the demons' never-ending reinforcements, it did not kill those fiends already present or purify the blight pervading the landscape. Most of the Mendevian Crusade's might has been redirected to face Tar-Baphon far to the south, and the holy crusaders who remain are no longer as numerous or as vigilant as they once were. The demon-haunted ruins of Storasta, Undarin, and Iz\u2014three Sarkorian cities that were overrun shortly after the Worldwound opened\u2014have each been reclaimed, but the prospect of rebuilding on such defiled sites was so daunting that the victors razed and abandoned them instead. For now, the soot-stained mines outside Iz and the murky Sarkora River, flowing over the rubble of Undarin, have been left to demons and the dead.",
						"Nevertheless, a small but courageous coalition of crusaders, adherents of the Green Faith, children of lost Sarkoris, and the old Sarkorian gods is determined to restore what it can. Their only permanent outpost is the small town of Gundrun, which they have built up into a walled and warded fort stockpiled with supplies. Otherwise, these self-proclaimed Reclaimers prefer a nomadic lifestyle. In part, this is because the witch-wardens and warriors of old Sarkoris viewed the wanderer's way as cleaner and nobler than the hierarchical life of towns, but the Reclaimers also favor nomadism because the Sarkoris Scar remains too dangerous to settle. Until more of the region has been purified, any attempt at large-scale encampment outside Gundrun seems profoundly unwise.",
						"Rather than rebuild cities, the Reclaimers focus on restoring wildlands. The mystical city of Dyinglight and its ring of aurora idols, and the repositories of ancient druidic traditions hidden deep in the Shudderwood, are two of their primary targets. However, both of these sites remain in corrupted hands: Dyinglight is surrounded by clans of fiendish, cannibalistic giants, while the Shudderwood's native fey have been corrupted into tormented and perverted forms. Even the wild animals who roam those lands show the lingering touch of the Abyss in their glowing eyes, unnatural stench, and rampant bloodlust. Still, the Reclaimers are making slow, painful progress. There is no safety in the Sarkoris Scar\u2014not yet. But for the first time in a long while, there is hope."

With the rise of Tar-Baphon hindering trade across Lake Encarthan, the Sellen River has become even more crucial to the cultural and economic lives of the nations it connects. Originating in the Lake of Mists and Veils, the river runs south through Numeria and the eastern River Kingdoms before serving as a natural border for many of Avistan's central nations, then spilling into the Inner Sea.

As the river and its tributaries run south, the current slows and the waterway broadens, no longer confined to leaping rapids between walls of glacier-carved rock. Grasslands and rich forests unfurl on the riverbanks, and outposts become more common.",

The river is too vast for anyone to completely control it, however, and smugglers, pirates, and cutthroats flourish along its less populated reaches. An entire secondary economy has sprung up to shield travelers from these threats, but it's an open secret that many river pilots and mercenary escorts switch sides to play pirate when their legitimate business slows."

He learned he could use the shard still lodged in his hand as a devastating weapon, remotely detonating the other shards of the shattered shield. His agents\u2014a group of necromancers and death cultists called the Whispering Way\u2014stole the shards and placed them in key sites, including Lastwall's capital of Vigil and in the shadowed halls of Gallowspire. The Gallowspire explosion cracked the crusaders' great seal and freed the Whispering Tyrant. After setting loose hordes of undead across Lastwall\u2014now known as the Gravelands\u2014the lich moved against Absalom, determined to seize the power of the Starstone. Powerful heroes sacrificed themselves to detonate the shard in Tar-Baphon's own hand, staining the area now known as the Tyrant's Grasp with his necromantic power but forcing the Whispering Tyrant back to his phylactery on the Isle of Terror. The Whispering Tyrant now amasses his undead armies and prepares to ravage Avistan anew."

						"Cartographers may designate the lands between the Tusk Mountains, the Kodar Mountains, and the Mindspin Mountains \"Belkzen,\" but there is no such formal nation and few of its mainly orc residents would deem it a place name. To them, Belkzen is the name a legendary hero, an orc warlord who united the tribes in the area and conquered the dwarven Sky Citadel of Koldukar more than 8,000 years ago. Belkzen renamed the city Urgir, and it remains the largest city in the region by far. Although Belkzen's alliance collapsed after his death, fracturing the orcs into dozens of feuding tribes, Urgir remains a symbol of power to the them, and despite constant turnovers in leadership the city has continued to grow. More recently, a clever and far-sighted warlord named Grask Uldeth, chieftain of the Empty Hand tribe, saw the economic benefits other nations enjoyed and sought to bring them to Urgir by means other than by simply stealing them. Uldeth created a system of tokens allowing non-orcs to travel through Belkzen freely in exchange for tribute payments, encouraged merchants to relocate to Urgir with light taxes and complete indifference to unscrupulous wares, and ensured their protection in the city with a rudimentary police force called the Closed Fist. Uldeth was slain by a mysterious assassin in 4716 and his steward, Ardax the White-Hair, now serves as Overlord of Urgir. Ardax leads the Closed Fist but not the Empty Hand, which has given him more time to coordinate improvements to the city. Chief among these has been the discovery of several caches of dwarven weapons underneath the city, along with a huge herd of rust monsters that now patrol with the Closed Fist like trained dogs.",
						"When the Whispering Tyrant broke free from Gallowspire, he sent several envoys to regain the allegiances of the orc hordes, just has he had 15 centuries ago. The tribes of Belkzen remembered what had happened to their ancestors under Tar-Baphon, however, and this time the orcs refused to fight and die for the lich-king. The orcs slaughtered the undead envoys as an answer and mounted the envoys' heads on the walls of Urgir. The Whispering Tyrant was enraged by this defiance, sending an army of undead to cow the orcs in response. In the Battle of Nine Broken Skulls outside of Urgir, Ardax led a desperate coalition of orc tribes to victory over the undead army. The Whispering Tyrant had sought to break the orcs' morale, but he succeeded only in teaching them how much stronger they could be together.",
						"The orcs know it's only a matter of time before the Whispering Tyrant sends a larger force or, worse, marches to Urgir personally. While even the most stubborn of the tribes have conceded they must solidify into a united front to repel this incipient threat, they struggle to overcome a long history of strife. Belkzen's land is harsh and unyielding, and it receives little rain except during the spring floods that turn the region's largest thoroughfare\u2014the Flood Road\u2014from a wide, dry valley into a river. The orc tribes now struggle to work together to share the resources of their hard land, and fiercely debate whether to reach out to long-despised neighbors for aid against the Whispering Tyrant's wrath. Orcs who aren't warriors have used this trying time to gain influence and prestige, both due to their skills at managing resources and their relative neutrality in orc tribal grudges. For the first time in millennia, Belkzen's orcs value caretakers, artisans, and negotiators\u2014not just its warriors."

						"The Fangwood is an ancient forest, populated by fey in the ages before Earthfall. When dwarves and Kellid wanderers discovered the Fangwood, they found it rich in resources. The fey, disturbed by these unfriendly intruders, rallied behind Gendowyn, an ancient, powerful, and capricious fey noble. Gendowyn used guile and trickery to repel the intruders, and before long, the dwarves had withdrawn and the Kellid settlers declared the forest taboo. Gendowyn then reached out to her chastened neighbors, forming strong alliances that lasted for thousands of years.",
						"Yet treachery lurks even among the fey, and one of Gendowyn's handmaidens, Arlantia, had secretly devoted herself to Cyth-V'sug, the demon lord of fungus and parasites. In 4062, over 200 years after the end of the Shining Crusade, Arlantia overthrew and imprisoned Gendowyn before releasing a terrible plague throughout the northern Fangwood: a supernatural infection called the Darkblight. This plague spread quickly among the fey, warping their features and twisting their souls. The Darkblight's expansion was slowed by Nirmathi scouts in the Fangwood, who fought to protect their forest homes from the infection, and finally ended in 4717, when heroes from Nirmathas slew Arlantia and freed Gendowyn from her imprisonment.",
						"Today, Gendowyn rules from her Accressiel Palace in the heart of the Fangwood, but her rule is far from secure. Pockets of the Darkblight remain, and the dense northern section of the Fangwood is home to orcs, dragons, and other threats that murder fey on sight. Keenly aware of her need for allies, Gendowyn has established relations with the Nirmathi and the druids of Crystalhurst, particularly the scouts and freedom fighters called the Chernasardo Rangers. Still, relations between fractious humans and fickle fey are strained even at the best of times, and both sides welcome intermediaries skilled with negotiation or primal magic."

Although the crusaders still found purpose in fighting to contain the orcs of Belkzen, many knights believed their organization's glory days were behind them. Their vigilance and zeal gradually dwindled.",
						"Meanwhile, the Whispering Tyrant plotted his escape and eventually developed the destructive weapon known as the Radiant Fire. In the devastating summer of 4719, Tar-Baphon obliterated the village of Roslar's Coffer and the crusader capital of Vigil. At the same time, Whispering Way cells throughout Lastwall synchronized murders, arson, and undead uprisings that shattered the nation. In one season, Lastwall was broken. Lastwall's ruler, Watcher-Lord Ulthun II, was forced to retreat to Absalom. Lastwall's most influential priest, Aylunna Varvatos, leads recently arrived Magaambyan philanthropists and the stone-faced crusaders who organize daily evacuations aboard ships departing Vellumis.",

Goblin tribes and those few orcs who chose to ally themselves with the Whispering Tyrant now travel openly within the nation's former borders. Most of Lastwall's population has already fled, and only the truly desperate remain huddled in crumbling strongholds or on failing farms. To travel openly across the Gravelands is to court death, but the surviving Knights of Ozem\u2014now called the Knights of Lastwall\u2014seek to stem the tide of evil, even in the face of incredible odds. Legendary crusader fortresses such as Castle Everstand and Castle Firrine stand empty, abandoned when their defenders could no longer count on supplies or support. These castles still stand tall on rolling hills, each as empty and grim as a tomb."

Although the lake harbors pirates and monsters, the opportunity for profit makes navigating its waters worth the risks.",
						"Today, Lake Encarthan is more dangerous than ever, due to the Whispering Tyrant's activity on and around the Isle of Terror. This large island at the lake's center was never a place visited by the sensible. Strange storms whipped the lake for miles around it, and the island's rocky shores provided few safe places to anchor. Now that the Whispering Tyrant has returned, the negative energy storms around the island roil constantly, and the island contains an even greater undead presence. Unlike in the Gravelands, where mobs of undead roam under the guidance of undead officers or Whispering Way necromancers, the undead on the Isle of Terror are almost all powerful individuals who serve in Tar-Baphon's courts and aid him in his plot to scour the lands of the living. Flying and swimming undead range further than ever before, sometimes as far as the coastal settlements.",

The river's dark, poisonous waters flow down from the Three Furies, the mountain range at the island's heart. Deep in the Three Furies yawn the Wizard-King's Pit and its Well of Sorrows, a trap that Tar-Baphon set for Aroden millennia ago. The trap is rumored to still be active and poised to snare careless explorers.",
						"Not all inhabitants of the Isle of Terror are beholden to the Whispering Tyrant. The terror wolves that prowl the island's forests are a threat to any travelers, and the living trees in the Shadow's Heart forest bear a passionate animosity toward all intruders. A powerful undead dragon named Karamorros hides on the island, fuming and plotting. Karamorros had planned to murder Tar-Baphon due to an old vendetta, but her hasty attack on the returned Whispering Tyrant recently led to a humiliating rout. Although Karamorros and her minions, the Whisperscale lizardfolk, might serve as allies for those who wish to confront the Whispering Tyrant, she is every bit as crafty and wicked as her enemy.",

During this alignment, creatures can step out of the Negative Energy Plane and onto the island, where the Whispering Tyrant presses them into service.

						"The imperialistic and territorial nation of Molthune was merely a province of Cheliax until it declared its independence\u2014and its willingness to fight to keep its sovereignty\u2014in 4632 AR. To solidify control within its borders, the Molthuni established a military oligarchy of nine general lords and created a burdensome series of taxes to fund a standing army. While the elite in the southern cities of Canorate and Korholm benefited from these measures, the northern territories found the taxes onerous and, in 4655 AR, rebelled to form the fiercely independent nation of Nirmathas. Since then, Molthune has warred with Nirmathas to reclaim its lost territory, with the conflict alternating between bloody combat and uneasy cease-fire.",
						"This dynamic has changed only recently with the creation of the new hobgoblin nation of Oprak and the reemergence of the Whispering Tyrant, which have forced Molthune to cool many of its military operations on the Nirmathi border. The crushing defeat of northern Molthune's forces by the hobgoblin General Azaersi, though officially derided as the fault of the commander in charge and not a reflection of Molthune as a whole, caused a great deal of soul-searching and finger-pointing among the higher echelons of Mothune's government. The rise of the Whispering Tyrant has widened these divisions further, as some generals recognize that the current threat requires alliances to survive, while other generals believe that crushing Nirmathas, Oprak, and Tar-Baphon single-handedly is the only way to regain face after being humiliated. Pragmatic-minded Molthuni diplomats and merchants have been making tenuous connections with their counterparts in Nirmathas, although bellicose spies and saboteurs frequently infiltrate these delegations. Only time will tell if Molthune will ally with other nations against the Whispering Tyrant, or doom the entire region out of pride and shortsightedness.",
						"Residents of Molthune have, traditionally, been divided into imperial citizens and indentured laborers. Although indentured laborers cannot vote and have their travel and trade limited to specific regions within the nation, they can\u2014as of 4710\u2014ascend to citizenship with 5 years of military service or some other, regulated service to the state. Immigrants are also eligible, and Lastwall refugees have flocked to Molthune as a result. Proof of earned citizenship comes in the form of a large iron coin with a number and the red flag of Molthune upon it; those who have \"earned the red coin\" are often unpopular with the aristocratic elite but have swelled the ranks of the Molthuni military forces. Molthune also makes use of mercenary companies, both human and \"monstrous,\" though this practice has come under heavy criticism after General Azaersi made use of Molthune's resources to raise the Ironfang Legion and start the Ironfang Invasion.",
						"Despite its militaristic leadership, Molthune pursues diplomatic relations with those neighbors it cannot easily subjugate, including the economically powerful Druma and the Cheliax-backed nation of Isger. Only the foolish mistake this diplomacy for peace, however, as Molthune is quick to pounce on opportunities to fuel its expansionist agenda."

The crafty woodsfolk fought the armies of Molthune to a standstill and established themselves as an independent nation under the charismatic leader Irgal Nirmath in 4655 AR.

Now, the destruction of Lastwall and incursion of the Whispering Tyrant's undead forces have put Nirmathas in a keenly precarious position. The nation is managing to survive due to both the strong, experienced militia that was forged during the Ironfang Invasion and the influx of well-trained refugee knights from Lastwall, as well as the fact that the war between Nirmathas and Molthune has cooled due to external threats.

Its leader, General Azaersi, first rose to prominence as the commander of one of Molthune's non-human mercenary companies. She patiently attracted hobgoblins and other monstrous mercenaries to her side, ultimately swelling her troop into an army. When she had taken all the recruits Molthune could offer, she broke with Molthune and led her army into Nirmathas. With the aid of a powerful artifact called the Onyx Key, Azaersi and her troops made their base in a strange castle deep within the Plane of Earth called the Vault of the Onyx Citadel. From there, she could create dimensional pathways to any location she chose, allowing the Ironfang Legion to move supplies and troops with ease.",
						"Azaersi's legion rapidly conquered much of southwestern Nirmathas, and she would have extended her domain further if a group of heroes had not raised a militia to halt her advance. The militia commanders eventually confronted Azaersi in the Onyx Citadel and convinced her that her relentless warmongering would bring nothing but destruction to her people. Exhausted by the toll the war had taken on her army, her friendships, and herself, Azaersi elected to withdraw her troops into the mountains and use the Onyx Citadel to establish Oprak as a homeland for hobgoblins and other creatures seen as monsters.",
						"Azaersi carved her lands on Golarion from a sparsely inhabited section of the Mindspin Mountains between Nirmathas and Nidal. The general and her advisors\u2014the Enclave Council\u2014were careful when drawing their borders to exclude the dwarven free city of Kraggodan, but Azaersi all but dared her neighbors to contest her claim. Representatives from the Umbral Court of Nidal were the first to meet with Azaersi and acknowledge the hobgoblin general's sovereignty, agreeing to a 3-year nonaggression pact. Shortly thereafter, Forest Marshal Dardinna Yallis of Nirmathas approached Azaersi under heavy guard to discuss diplomatic relations, and agreed to peace for 4 years. Yallis hopes that because the hobgoblins are scheduled to end their peace with Nidal first, they will look west rather than east for military conquests.",
						"General Azaersi maintains the military arm of her nation\u2014still called the Ironfang Legion\u2014but has solidly shifted her nation's focus to developing a robust economy. Due to the extraplanar nature of the Onyx Citadel, Oprak is currently the safest nation in the region from the threat of the Whispering Tyrant, and Azaersi is currently avoiding military conflict in order to fully develop her new homeland's resources and tactical advantages. Hobgoblins and other creatures willing to serve as explorers, miners, smiths, and alchemists have been flocking to the fledgling nation.",
						"Although Oprak is little more than three hundred miles across and consists primarily of forbidding mountains, the hobgoblins have substantially more resources than they have revealed to the rest of the world. The Onyx Citadel rests in a large, verdant cavern that the hobgoblins call the Onyx Vault, which is even larger than the territory Azaersi claims on Golarion. Created long ago by a powerful species of terraformers called xiomorns, the Onyx Vault has a variety of terrain, its own day and night cycle, and even clouds and rain. The hobgoblins are industriously taming this strange land, negotiating with powerful elemental natives, and mining the profusion of gems and ores in the wondrous place.",
						"Golarion's connections to the Onyx Citadel\u2014paths known as the Stone Roads\u2014are guarded by legions of watchful hobgoblins. Five such entrances exist throughout the mountains of Oprak, the largest being the obsidian tower in the new capital Hunthul's heart.

Crafted over millennia by elemental might, the wish magic of bound genies, and the occult calculations of esoteric mathematicians, the empire rules unchallenged over several major trade routes, though its control dwindles northward among the nomadic horse tribes of the Windswept Wastes. Though the imperial line has never been broken, the current monarch, Kalish XXII, is already in his nineties, and many fear civil war between his numerous heirs when he finally dies."

						"The vast deserts of Garund's northern coast may look inhospitable, but it was here along their rugged shorelines and fertile rivers that human civilization first rebounded from the devastation of Earthfall.",
						"For a thousand years, humanity huddled in small bands and villages, eking out a bare existence under an ash-clouded sky, rarely organizing beyond localized trade networks. Then came the Jistka Imperium, clever artificers who rose from the deserts of what is now Rahadoum. The Imperium conquered the neighboring peoples and forced the desert dwellers in north-central Garund to form a defensive federation called the Tekritanin League, matched also by the rise of powerful Ancient Osirion in the east. In the ensuing conflict between these three nations, Osirion eventually ended up victorious through a combination of astute politics, magic, and brute military force, its god-kings conquering both of the neighboring empires. But Ancient Osirion eventually met its end as well, finally collapsing under the weight of its own hubris. Keleshite agents from Qadira, a vassal of the vast Padishah Empire of Kelesh just across the Obari Ocean, took advantage of this decline. These agents destabilized the region until Qadira could sweep in and \"rescue\" Osirion from disaster, turning it into a Keleshite colony. This foreign rule in Osirion lasted for more than 3 millennia before Khemet I, dubbed the Forthbringer, drove the Keleshite government from its shores and returned Osirion to sovereign rule by a Garundi pharaoh.",
						"While this chaos played out in the east, things were going equally poorly in the west. Spread by Keleshite immigration, the worship of Sarenrae hit the city of Azir and other major settlements like an avalanche, meeting violent resistance from local followers of Nethys and Norgorber. The resulting Oath Wars devastated the region for more than 60 years before Azir's militia ended the conflict by burning all temples and establishing a fiercely secular nation, which they dubbed Rahadoum. Meanwhile, south of Osirion, Sarenite refugees and bandits carved settlements out of arid and sparsely populated plains, guarded from marauding bands of gnolls by the legendary janni heroes called the Templars of the Five Winds. It was only with the arrival of the alien Pactmasters and their laissez-faire, plutocratic governance that this new nation of Katapesh came into its own as a hub of worldwide trade.",
						"Today the nations collectively dubbed the Golden Road are a study in contrast. In their bustling, cosmopolitan cities, markets overflow with curiosities from across the world, while scholars advance the frontiers of magic and science in buildings older than many northern nations. Yet at the same time, settlements remain largely restricted to coasts and rivers, leaving huge stretches of land untouched, ceded to deadly monsters and those bold adventurers willing to brave them. In these sun-drenched dunes ruled by scorpions, genies, fiends, and sphinxes, heroes find their fortunes\u2014or are swallowed forever."

In Osirion, the mountain monastery of Tar Kuata houses monks and scholars of Irori as well as an order of elite dwarven martial artists called the Ouat. A sect of druids called the Stonewardens patrols the central range near Thuvia, guarding hidden sanctuary valleys and remote portals to the First World, while the legendary alchemist Artokus Kirran built his citadel among the peaks, using their slopes as his first line of defense.",

Among its rubble, marids and monstrous humanoids battle over priceless sites including the Fields of Glass, the Domes of the Polymatum, and the Pit of Endless Night. Lesser-known sites in the range include the Cathedral of Claws, the Tagas Labyrinth, and the lair of the undead dragon Arantaros. Among the northern Mwangi peoples, adventuring scholars search for the Earthspear, a spiraling repository carved into the heart of a mountain. The Earthspear is said to hold writings from Old-Mage Jatembe himself, protected in case of a second apocalypse.

In Katapesh, those with the gold make the rules, and the only question is whether one can afford their desires.",

Fleeing south from pogroms in Osirion, these devout settlers founded two cities that would eventually become Solku and Katapesh. Yet life was hard on Katapesh's plains, and constant assault by gnolls, bandits, and destructive sandstorms led subsequent generations away from the faith, seeking salvation in something more concrete.",

Trade boomed as residents of the Inner Sea region clamored for the new drug, and with the influx of money came warring gangs and pesh dens full of helpless addicts. As the economic boom and influx of foreign trade allowed local merchants to expand into other wares, the fundamental anarchy of a drug-fueled economy continued under a loose consortium of corrupt merchants and outright criminals.",

Though they didn't end the city's freewheeling approach to trade, they stabilized and formalized it. Under their guidance, usually filtered through humanoid mouthpieces like Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid, the nation has become perhaps the largest black market in the world, its independence maintained by economic ties and a constabulary of metal constructs known as aluums.",

There, the ruins of Tumen, Osirion's former capital, buried by sandstorms after the death of the Four Pharaohs of Ascension. For every known site of legend, a dozen more lie undiscovered. Upon taking the throne, the Ruby Prince, Khemet III, briefly invited foreign scholars and archaeologists to explore these sites, advancing his goal of raising Osirion's profile while learning more of the secrets behind the ancients' miracles. But after both the disastrous return of the Sky Pharaoh a few years ago and uncovering the secret machinations of the Night Heralds hidden among the area's sites, the prince has attempted to restrict access once more, succeeding only in driving the thriving tomb- robbing business underground. The elites of other nations now have developed a desire for Osirian relics. For those bold enough to face trap-filled corridors, undead guardians, and ravenous monsters, the threat of government punishment does little to keep them from launching expeditions in search of priceless artifacts.

						"Long ago, the high deserts of Qadira were home to nomadic herders who mingled with local genies and elementals, giving rise to a large population of geniekin. Even today it's not uncommon for geniekin to be born to parents who may have otherwise had no idea of their elemental ancestry. Qadira's early inhabitants created little in the way of permanent settlements. When the armies of the Padishah Empire of Kelesh rolled west into the region, seeking a trade port along the Inner Sea, these scattered bands had little choice but to assimilate into their conquerors' society.",
						"By far the invaders' greatest influence on the region was the introduction of their Keleshite empire's patron goddess, Sarenrae. With her dervishes wielding healing light and righteous steel, the Dawnflower spread across the Inner Sea like a grass fire, finding legions of converts while sparking wars in northern Garund. This dichotomy between healing and harm was felt even within Qadira itself, where Sarenrae's faith is the state religion, as the goddess's emphasis on forgiveness clashed with Kelesh's expansionist tendencies. Most recently, the church's push to abolish slavery\u2014a crusade that seems poised on the brink of victory\u2014has made its priests unwelcome in slaving ports like Sedeq, where bottled djinn, shaitans trapped in amber, humanoid prisoners, and caged monsters all line the slave block.",
						"As the point of Kelesh's spear, Qadira earns little love from its neighbors. Nobody inside or outside its borders has forgotten the way the empire swooped in to annex Osirion for millennia, or its centuries of brutal warfare with Taldor to the north. Of late, the rise of Grand Princess Eutropia as a strong ruler in Taldor has forced Satrap Xerbystes II to quiet his saber rattling. While the prideful satrap might wish otherwise, final command of the nation's armies belongs not to him but to his vizier Hebizid Vraj. Hebizid was appointed by the Padishah Emperor himself and able to overrule the satrap, should Xerbystes make decisions against the empire's interest. The satrap focuses instead on economic victories and defending the hundred stone watchtowers along the contested border. He satisfies his martial desires with the Peerless, a hand-selected group of heroes who undertake impossible missions into the nation's wild places for their monarch's glory and entertainment.",
						"Ordinary Qadirans are just as proud as their leaders, and with good reason: each day they see their shores flooded with visitors who gape at the marvels of the Keleshite empire, from its animated siege engines and flying carpets to bands of genie mercenaries and great elemental-powered sandships that sail the dunes on phantom winds. Caravans arrive daily in Katheer, showcasing creatures and knowledge unseen in the west, and the Venicaan College of Medicaments and Chirurgery blends magic and medical science to train the greatest healers for thousands of miles. Most Qadirans are legendarily persuasive, confident, and concerned with luxury and status, yet also honorable and generous. Hospitality is both sacred and formalized, with breaches of etiquette risking deadly feuds. Even criminals observe these codes of conduct.",
						"Outside of the great caravan cities, Qadiran settlements are small and must defend themselves against feral giants, draconic beasts, angry elementals, and the other creatures of the desert. Sometimes residents are able to live in harmony with these strange creatures, such as in the scholarly enclave of Gurat, where a cyclops prophet called the Mouthpiece speaks invaluable truths to the satrap and is guarded by a thousand deaf soldiers. Legends also speak of independent settlements of geniekin high in the Zho Mountains, still resisting the empire's control. Though the settlements are hidden by powerful illusion spells, adventurers occasionally stumble across them, or they may reveal themselves to the worthy in moments of need. The more common outcome for adventurers, however, is finding only ruins, like those of Al-Bashir, whose resident harpies devour unwary caravans, or of lost Shadun, where shadows with burning eyes walk the ashen streets. Most practical caravan leaders headed through Qadira's deserts hire plenty of guards, making the nation a popular destination for both foreign mercenaries and elite local sellswords."

A child of the chaos that followed the collapse of Ancient Osirion, Artokus met with local leaders and concocted a plan to use the vast wealth generated by the elixir to help his fellow downtrodden nomads. Artokus would remain a hermit, secreted in a hidden and heavily defended citadel in the Barrier Wall. Each year, he would send forth a blind, mute servant bearing six vials of the elixir. These would then be auctioned off\u2014never to fellow Thuvians, lest they incur Pharasma's wrath\u2014in a one-bid auction, with all proceeds (including the losing bids) going to the government.

Foreign gold has built vast palaces and irrigation projects, universities and theaters.

The city is a port of pleasures, dedicated to artists and hedonists of all sorts and popular with tourists even in its off years thanks to the savvy policies of Queen Zamere. The isolated city of Duwwor, by contrast, has little interest in outsiders, and its citizens are devoted to living in harmony with the land. Boasting an immense temple to Gozreh and closely allied with a circle of desert druids, Duwwor is home to the best guides in the nation, taking scholars and adventurers deep into the dunes in search of the ruins of the Tekritanin League. Just as famous are the windmills that adorn Duwwor's buildings and fields, harnessing the desert winds to power ingenious constructs and industry.",
						"Smallest of the great cities is Pashow, dedicated to Nethys and organized around arcanists studying or teaching at the Scrollspire, the magical university built atop the entrance to an ancient Tekritanin library-well. Pashow's isolation makes it vulnerable to raids by the Water Lords, nomadic warriors who inhabit the nation's trackless interior, and the Scrollspire regularly shelters townsfolk within its walls.",
						"Of the numerous monsters that hunt Thuvia's wastes, the most feared are the fiendish divs. Long ago, the div demigod Ahriman dwelled in Thuvia's heart, called there by the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues and housed in the vast magical palace known as the House of Oblivion. While Ahriman was eventually driven back to Abaddon, his murderous divs lurk throughout the desert, served by nihilistic cultists called the Usij."

						"The seas surrounding Avistan and Garund are rough and lawless places. Controlled by no nation, the Arcadian Ocean teems with pirates and raiders, from the Free Captains of the Shackles to the dragon-headed longships of the Linnorm Kings. Since gaining control of both sides of the Arch of Aroden—the massive ruined bridge across the Hespereth Strait between Avistan and Garund—Cheliax’s navy has limited these brigands’ access to the Inner Sea, yet that by no means makes the seas safe. Okeno’s yellow-sailed slave galleys engage in a perpetual and bloody game of cat-and-mouse with Andoran’s abolitionist Gray Corsairs, and plenty of other homegrown threats hunt the depths. Yet despite the danger, the waterways of the Inner Sea region are crucial to trade. Merchant fleets of all sorts travel its sea lanes, carrying goods and travelers between neighboring nations or setting off for the far side of the globe.",
						"Most nations with a coastline have some sort of navy, but a few stand out as particularly noteworthy. Constantly at each other’s throats, Andoran and Cheliax have the two largest fleets, their warships forever harassing each other but keeping just short of actions that would tip them into outright war. Once an equally formidable power, Taldor’s navy is only recently being built up again after dwindling for several decades, though it still runs a legendary shipyard that can build a warship in a single week. Absalom maintains a significant fleet, aided by gillmen and the unique hippocampus-mounted cavalry called Wave Riders. As the most valuable port in the Inner Sea, Absalom has been forced to call on its navy many times to maintain its independence, yet it follows the lead of most other nations and restricts itself to strictly defensive operations. Fleets on the Arcadian Ocean tend to be much smaller, with the Free Captains dominating the southern waters and Cheliax guarding the northern ones, though nations like Rahadoum and even individual cities like Magnimar and Korvosa need to maintain significant defenses against ocean-going raiders and the plethora of monstrous threats lurking beneath the waves.",
						"Since the demise of Azlant during Earthfall, crossing the Arcadian Ocean has been considered madness by many Inner Sea residents, with Arcadia itself a half-believed legend. Tales of bold adventurers raiding the shattered isles of Azlant for the fantastic treasures lingering in its half-drowned ruins have been staples of storytellers since Aroden first led survivors to the mainland. In recent years, news of state-sponsored overseas colonies have begun capturing popular imagination. Still, for most sailors in the region, the Arcadian Ocean might as well represent the western edge of the world. The vast majority of traders never leave sight of land—and those who do are often persuaded of their folly by merfolk, sea devils, brine dragons, and other predators of the deep ocean."

						"Inner Sea legends often place any sufficiently marvelous location in the ruins of Azlant, and the truth is that even after millennia of degradation, the actual sites uncovered by explorers are every bit as magical as their legends. Much of the Inner Sea region’s initial knowledge of the lost empire came from famed Pathfinder Durvin Gest. Delving into an Azlanti sea stack temple called the House of Aeons, he discovered not just a vast trove of magical aeon stones but a giant metal book called the Infalabulum that described many of the empire’s wonders and their locations, guiding both Gest’s future explorations and those of the Pathfinder Society.",
						"The most marvelous of Azlant’s ruins is its former capital, the City of Golden Gates. Said to be literally the perfect city, granted by Abadar as an example to the Material Plane, the hillside metropolis was destroyed by a direct strike during Earthfall; its Imperial Palace and Throne of Glass shattered, and much of the city sank beneath the waves. Today, the underwater portions of its ruins are guarded by jealous alghollthus— the intelligent ichthyoid monsters who rule the deeps—while dragons and formerly bound demons stalk the dry portions.",
						"One of the few cities to survive Earthfall—after a fashion—is Acrolan, the first of the Seven Secret Cities crafted as havens for the psychic Ascended Adepts. Though Acrolan’s towers and palaces of colored glass were smashed, the secret truth is that the ruined land was only ever a monument to the real city, which lies behind it on the Ethereal Plane. Warped into hateful wraiths by the trauma of their civilization’s end, the Ascended Adepts who once populated Acrolan still wait within the broken temples for those who can pass the tests to ascend to the true city and battle its masters for their vast wealth.",
						"The temple-city of Bilith-Vel is ruled by the undead monstrosity Rezallian, a lunar dragon who was horrifically warped by the death of his liege Acavna, the Azlanti goddess of the moon and battle. Acavna’s death during Earthfall left Rezallian to oversee the dregs of the city’s population: Azlanti degenerated into morlocks or risen as draugr, and giant, tentacled flatworms from the far side of the moon. Bilith-Vel’s towers and statues to the dead goddess are sunk halfway under the waves but are still connected by soaring bridges.",
						"Yet not all of Azlant’s most notable sites are haunted by survivors. Aroden’s Rock was one of Azlant’s tallest mountains prior to Earthfall, when it was reshaped into a mere island; there, Aroden and his followers built ships to sail east and start a new civilization. Today, the island teems with the murderous fey who opposed Aroden then, ruled by Ugurskogg, a terrifying entity from the planet’s earliest days. And unmarked on any map, the fabled Towers of Heaven that were once Azlant’s secret route to reaching the stars still stand dry in their salt-flat desert, guarded by a mu spore who hopes to harness their power to return home to a distant world."

						"Aroden’s death in 4606 ar wracked Golarion physically and culturally, yet perhaps no evidence of his passing is so great as the massive, terrifying storm that sprang up in the Abendego Gulf. Now a stationary, seemingly permanent hurricane, the Eye of Abendego lashed Garund’s western coast, drowning the nations of Lirgen and Yamasa and creating the flooded wastes known today as the Sodden Lands. While the timing of its appearance clearly ties it to the death of humanity’s patron god, scholars still know little about the magic that powers it or what keeps it tethered in place. Scrying spells reveal a calm central eye clogged thick with flotsam ranging from the minuscule to entire floating structures, yet expeditions attempting to investigate in person invariably find themselves beset by air elementals, undead, and sea monsters.",
						"Still, the danger and mystery of the storm haven’t prevented neighboring cultures from finding ways to make use of it. For the pirates of the Shackles, the hurricane’s winds serve as a natural defense against the navies of the north. It also serves as a barrier restricting sea lanes and forcing vulnerable traders looking for sea access to the Mwangi Expanse to come right past the pirates’ isles. Most Free Captains learn to use the endless storm to their advantage, darting out of its squalls to take their prey unaware before disappearing back into the storm, stymieing any pursuit. The pirate lords even host an annual race through the hurricane’s edges— the Free Captain’s Regatt —with the winner awarded an island and a seat on the Pirate Council. Similarly, the Red Mantis of Mediogalti Island use the storm’s wrath as a convenient buffer against invasion by other nations. Amid the storm’s wrack and beneath its waves, bloodthirsty adaros, sea devils, and krakens hunt for hapless victims and wayward treasure. And on the mainland, the boggard tribes of the Sodden Lands worship the storm as a manifestation of Rovagug."

						"A dragon-ruled civilization in the Steaming Sea, Hermea is the topic of legends and rumors among children and adults alike across the Inner Sea region. For centuries, the gold dragon Mengkare watched humanity bicker and constantly refuse to rise above their baser nature to realize their full potential. Yet while other metallic dragons largely dismissed humanity, Mengkare remained impressed by human resilience and resourcefulness, becoming convinced that—with a little guidance—they might one day become the civilization that would bring peace and prosperity to the planet for good. At last seeing a cause noble enough to dedicate his life to, he immediately relocated to an empty island in the southern Steaming Sea and used the wealth of his vast hoard to found Hermea, a nation dedicated to his vision of perfecting humanity.",
						"Dubbed the Glorious Endeavor, Mengkare’s campaign is shrouded in mystery. Under his command, covert scouts travel the world seeking out humans who are paragons of both intelligence and physical prowess, often tracking them for years before issuing the handful of invitations Mengkare authorizes each year. Those who accept are transported to Hermea and presented with the Contract of Citizenship, in which the chosen agree to cede their free will and be bound by Mengkare’s enlightened judgment forever. All former nationalities and allegiances must be renounced, including even organized religion. In exchange, recipients are promised permanent access to Hermea’s extensive resources and a life of perpetual comfort while they pursue their passions in a closed society of brilliant and beautiful peers.",
						"According to residents, life in Hermea is dedicated to fulfilling one’s potential, whether that be through magic or art, combat or science. While the island hosts some startlingly efficient agricultural projects, its economy is powered primarily by the sale of its crafts and expertise to outside nations. The harbor of the nation’s only city, Promise, bustles with traders and scholars. All business is conducted on the docks, as few outsiders are allowed within the city’s high sandstone walls. The state takes most of the funds earned in this manner, but Hermea’s citizens have no worries for money—each may requisition whatever they require, for a poet who dedicates himself to the perfect sonnet is just as valued by Hermean society as a wizard who crafts magical artifacts or a warrior who hires herself out to slay monsters in far-off kingdoms. Hermea’s population is almost entirely human, though Mengkare sometimes brings in exceptional members of other ancestries to teach at the island’s many universities, especially if they might add beneficial traits to the gene pool.",
						"Of course, while many residents of the Inner Sea region long for such a life of prestige and luxury, not everyone sees Mengkare’s experiment as noble. For many, the idea of a human breeding experiment is abhorrent no matter the goal, and asking someone to sign away their personal autonomy is akin to indenturing them. Yet proponents are quick to point to the arranged marriages common in many cultures and assert that the Hermean government is simply formalizing the practice. These advocates further claim that although Mengkare wields absolute power, he honors the intelligence and independence of his subjects and takes their preferences and happiness into account. While the presence of two draconic viziers who help oversee his mission earns some rumblings of resentment, Mengkare still defers to the 13 elected officials of the Council of Enlightenment for most governmental decisions.",
						"The greatest strain in Hermean society centers around the issue of family: while Hermea-born children are given every advantage, those who don’t show sufficient potential for Mengkare’s standards of greatness when they undergo the Assessment at age 16 are banished to the mainland, never to return. Known grounds for banishment include merely average intelligence, lack of life goals, mental illness of any kind, physical impairments, and disruptive behavior; in other instances, the reason is a mystery to both the unfortunate exiles and their families."

						"The largest landmass off the western coast of Garund, Mediogalti Island seems at first glance a wild place, made even more perilous by its residents. In its misty jungles, monkey goblins and kobolds hunt—or hide from—ferocious dinosaurs and ruthless lizardfolk, while pirates of all stripes carouse in the deepwater port of Ilizmagorti. Yet beneath the surface chaos, the island is in fact a tightly controlled nation run by one of the most feared organizations on Golarion: the Red Mantis assassins.",
						"Following a vision from their murderous god Achaekek, the Red Mantis fled the Oath Wars in Rahadoum and settled the island in 2559 ar. They quickly began construction on a new headquarters, the Crimson Citadel, deep in the verdant mountains of the island’s interior. After it was finally completed nearly 4 decades later, the cult turned its attention to converting the existing pirate town of Ilizmagorti on the island’s northern shore into a haven for criminals and fugitives, the better to host those looking to contact the assassins with job offers. Though the Red Mantis has little interest in directly governing the affairs of locals, it officially owns all establishments on the island, with proprietors paying for the privilege of operating them. The city’s constantly shifting population of thieves and scoundrels remains astonishingly polite due to the well-known fact that most members of the Red Mantis live covertly among the city’s residents, so any bartender or shopkeeper could be a highly skilled assassin in disguise.",
						"The Red Mantis itself is a mysterious organization, though its agents, when active, are instantly recognizable by their black-and-red armor, mantis-like helmets, and sawtooth sabers. The assassins’ fame comes not just from their incredible reliability, but from the fact that they ensure their clients stay dead, preventing any chance of resurrection. Their fees vary widely, and while nonnegotiable, are largely symbolic—for the Red Mantis, assassination is a form of worship. All targets are valid apart from rightfully placed rulers of nations; these are exempted by divine law. Rank-and-file agents are self-organized into cells to fulfill various contracts, but all pay deference to the Blood Mistress, who acts as the undisputed voice of Achaekek, and to her Vernai (or “High Killers”), a cabal of mostly female assassin lords.",
						"Only Red Mantis members know the exact location of the Crimson Citadel— would-be clients who seek the cult’s attention instead typically advertise their desires in Ilizmagorti. Yet rumors of the stronghold’s wonders and horrors are still whispered in bars and throne rooms across Golarion. The lower levels, called the Ruby Halls to evoke walls stained with blood, are the cult’s training center, stocked with deadly beasts and traps. The central levels, called the Honeyed Gardens, make up a pleasure palace where the assassins celebrate successful jobs with every vice imaginable, relaxing in the spray of a waterfall of fresh blood. The fortress’s towers, called the Lavish Heart, house the cult’s leadership, while a hidden sanctum called the Iron Heart holds the Sarzari Library, said to be an impressive collection of ancient knowledge accessible only by the Blood Mistress herself."

						"Since time beyond memory, Golarion’s elves have been at war with the scheming alghollthus. Thus, when the Azlanti first rose to power as servants of the alghollthus’ so-called veiled masters, the elves considered the Azlanti enemies as well, and built a magical observatory off their shores to spy on them. These observers were among the first to learn of the alghollthus’ plan to bring about Earthfall, and they warned elvenkind to retreat to Sovyrian. When elves returned from Sovyrian millennia later, they found that their former outpost had been crushed by the falling body of Acavna, the Azlanti goddess of the moon and battle, who died trying to defend her people. In its place, a strange tower had grown—one that whispered to them with a goddess’s voice.",
						"In that voice and in the disturbing visions it granted, they found a calling. Now considering themselves the heirs of Azlant, the former observers settled in the tower and cut themselves off from the rest of the world, laying claim to the shattered continent. They guard it both to protect this claim and as defense against humanity ever rediscovering the power—and hubris—of the lost nation and somehow triggering a second Earthfall.",
						"After generations of isolation, the elves of the Mordant Spire are few in number and have become secretive and xenophobic, strange even to their former brethren. Often refusing to speak anything but Azlanti, they wear elaborate wooden masks whenever dealing with outsiders, and they often change the subject or stop speaking mid-sentence, cocking their heads as if listening to an inaudible voice. Completely self-sufficient, they live on rocky beaches and floating platforms anchored to the sea floor, tending kelp beds and fish farms. Outsiders are likely to interact with the elves only if they break the Mordant Spire’s rules against exploring Azlant’s ruins, in which case they find themselves quickly beset by elven warriors who patrol the region in rune-carved vessels that skim the waves faster than any ordinary ship. Captured trespassers have any Azlanti treasures confiscated and their minds wiped with magic.",
						"The Mordant Spire elves are highly regimented. The Amaranthine Council rules unconditionally and never leaves the tower; its members are marked by the purple vapor that leaks from their empty eye sockets. Beneath them, the Listeners keep to the Vigilant Halls near the tower’s peak, communing with the spirit of the tower and observing Azlant’s ruins through magical seawater lenses. When they detect a threat, they dispatch the Mordant Censors, the warriors and spellcasters who make up the bulk of the patrols. Many other specialized roles also exist, including the rare diplomats who warn other nations to stay away and the saboteurs who ensure any serious incursion never gets off the ground. Still, in recent years, some of the elves have begun to grudgingly work with colonists in Azlant to face larger alghollthu threats, and it may be only a matter of time until the Spire’s strict traditions change."

United under the first Hurricane King, the newly named Free Captains of the Shackles became a single fleet, their actions guided by the Pirate Council—pirate lords powerful enough to each control one of the archipelago’s major ports. In addition to its usual raiding, the new fleet sold its services to Sargava, promising to secure the colony’s independence from Cheliax in exchange for tribute. Though the overthrow of Sargava’s colonial government eventually ended the agreement, it lasted long enough for the pirate government to fully establish itself, and the buccaneer federation has to date managed to weather several invasions by fleets from Cheliax and Rahadoum. Today, under the rule of Hurricane Queen Tessa Fairwind, the pirates of the Shackles are bolder than ever before, raiding all along the western coasts of Avistan and Garund.",

By far the largest is Port Peril, situated on the mainland and guarded by the cannons of Fort Hazard on the cliffs overlooking Jeopardy Bay. In its narrow streets, fugitives cut deals with addicts and unscrupulous merchants, happily ignored by the pirates who run the town. Adventurers sometimes stop in the port before heading into the Terwa Uplands in search of legendary sites like the Temple of the Ravenous Moon—or down into the sea caves beneath the city, where fortunes in pirate gold are said to be stashed away.",
						"Yet the nation’s de facto capital is only one port of many. For most outsiders, the port of Quent is the most welcoming, with the Calistrian-run House of Stolen Kisses brokering companionship and information. Hell Harbor’s imp-filled sky and Chelish affectations offer a taste of the north, run by disgraced Chelish ex-admiral Arronax Endymion. For those who enjoy living on the edge, Widowmaker Island offers all manner of gambling and blood sports—including mock naval battles in a monster-infested lake. Less welcoming to outsiders are captains like the Master of Gales, the druid who rules the driftwood shanties of Drenchport, or Avimar Sorrinash, whose werewolf crew hunts his own port city of Ollo when the moon is full.",
						"Brigands of all kinds can make a home in the Shackles, but half-elves, half-orcs, and humans of all ethnicities are most common, along with the bird-headed tengus whom local sailors consider a sign of good luck. Outside the few settled ports, however, inhabitants quickly grow more monstrous, with sea devils and locathahs claiming the waters, lizardfolk Terwa Lords raiding from the north, and water nagas hunting the mainland along the Slithering Coast. Yet despite the danger, scoundrels and fortune-seekers of all nations continue to flock to the Shackles, seeking opportunity, hideouts, or possibly relics of the powerful sorceries that brought down the cyclopes’ empire."

						"The waterways of the Inner Sea region are more heavily populated below than they are above. Entire cultures lurk beneath the waves, often unknown to their coastal neighbors until they emerge from the water to trade—or to drag prisoners back to the briny deep. Merfolk are quick to punish those who trespass across their invisible borders, while sadistic goblinoid grindylows and clever sea hags love to wreak havoc on coastal settlements. Other aquatic cultures are more cooperative; for example, it’s not uncommon for curious locathahs—fish-like humanoids—to trade with ships or act as guides through dangerous waters. Tentacled cecaelias often act as nomadic mercenaries or traders, traveling from port to port leading pack rays loaded with salvage from the depths. And there’s plenty of such salvage to be found—thanks to the devastation of Earthfall, the floor of the Inner Sea is littered with the drowned ruins of elven and serpentfolk cities as well as countless shipwrecks. South toward Jalmeray, the waters quickly grow more dangerous, with creatures like the eel-like iku-tursos capturing whole ship crews for the undersea slave trade.",
						"The sea where the Arcadian Ocean meets Avistan and Garund is often thought of as two separate bodies. In the north, the Steaming Sea—so named for the fog that rises off its frigid waters—makes for a perilous home. While coastal Varisians and the Ulfen of the Ironbound Archipelago rely on the sea for survival, all know that its freezing waves can kill as quickly as the krakens, skum, and ravenous sea devils that plague ships venturing too far from their sheltering islands. In the south, the Fever Sea is warmer, but just as dangerous. For every friendly undersea group, like kraken-hunting squadrons of tritons, there are creatures like the storm-worshipping adaros who sacrifice prisoners to the Eye of Abendego. Still, the tropical waters are often worth risking, and magical salvage divers operating out of Vidrian and the Kaava Lands do a brisk business in artifacts and treasure pulled from sunken fleets or from the swampy apocalypse of the Sodden Lands.",

Only one thing is clear to all: that any undertaking large enough to gather a city of naturally independent alghollthus together must have disastrous consequences for others. So it is in Gholinom, deep in an ocean trench west of Rahadoum. As much a factory as a city, its mountainous, twisting towers have stood atop volcanic vents for millennia, gathering magical and geothermic power that crackles in magenta rings around them as black smoke billows from their tips. Conduits of stone and skymetal weave through the palaces and laboratories of the many-eyed masterminds and their terrified slave-scholars, all leading to a vast circular gate at the city’s heart. Dubbed the Passage Outward, this gateway consists of four concentric rings, each rotating in an opposing direction from those around it and made of a different skymetal—abysium, djezet, orichalcum, and inubrix. This gateway has never opened, yet those slaves most trusted (or burdened) with knowledge of the gate suggest that it’s intended to open onto a realm beyond space and time that their masters refer to as the Final Sea. The entire project was secret until just recently, when Professor Karnvale Havillip, a halfling venture-captain thought lost in a shipwreck years ago, returned to the Grand Lodge in Absalom bearing a harrowing tale of escape and a warning that, after ages of preparation, the Passage Outward may be about to open."

						"The independent kingdoms of Garund's so-called Impossible Lands trace their histories back millennia. Even today the region's sparkling cities, breathtaking monuments, and arcane accomplishments seem rooted in some distant epoch when miracles were commonplace and legendary monsters walked alongside heroes bound for grand destinies. In prehistoric times, the region fell under the domain of a vast cyclops empire, whose megalithic ruins and broad, half-buried causeways hint at a grandeur seldom matched in the present day. Long after Earthfall toppled these monuments and reduced their builders into scattered, survivalist masses, armies of the god-kings of Osirion established cities and colonies amid the ruins. Pharaonic legions brought an end to older human empires like the Jistka Imperium and the Tekritanin League along Garund's northwestern coast. They also conquered many of the scattered indigenous peoples of the continent's east coast, whether through pacification or subjugation, greatly extending the borders of their kingdom. Over millennia, the power of Osirion faded, and the weakened pharaohs cut off all contact with their distant colonies, leaving these nations to develop as independent kingdoms.",
						"The history of the Impossible Lands has been dominated by two of the region's most powerful nations\u2014both of which take their names from their respective immortal wizard-king founders, Geb and Nex. The two kingdoms clashed thousands of years ago in a devastating, centuries-long arcane war that warped the fabric of the continent itself. The most obvious scar of this conflict is the twisted wasteland that lies between them, a gnarled landscape of magic-warped terrain ravaged by arcane storms known as the Mana Wastes. From nightmare beasts born of the Fleshforges of Nex to the countless undead making up the populace of Geb, the region remains stained with the hubris of these two mages, and the thought of their lands once having been free from Nex and Geb's tyranny seems more fable than fact to the people caught in their wake.",
						"Despite this tumultuous history, the realms of Nex, Geb, and Jalmeray, along with the city-state of Alkenstar, count themselves among the mightiest and most fantastical nations in all the lands of the Inner Sea. Nex, who remains one of the most powerful and influential archmages Golarion has ever known, set the archetype for the Impossible Lands. Over the millennia of his immortal existence, he has taken control of the city-states of Quantium, Ecanus, and Oenopion, lavishing arcane innovations and architectural marvels upon them. Nex's hated enemy, the equally ancient ghost necromancer Geb, rules a cosmopolitan, prosperous nation that would be considered among Garund's wealthiest and most promising kingdoms, if not for the fact that most of its inhabitants are undead monstrosities who willingly followed their baleful leader into eternity to serve his dark designs forever. Off the coast, the lush isle of Jalmeray is a portal to western Casmaron, offering a slice of culture from distant Vudra on the doorstep of the Inner Sea. Monks from all over the world flock to the isle to hone their bodies and minds, following esoteric traditions handed down in antiquity by otherworldly spirits. Like Nex and Geb before them, these stalwarts intend through great effort and even greater creations to transcend the limits of the ordinary world\u2014a task suited for nowhere else but the Impossible Lands."

A former herald of Aroden cruelly raised from death by Geb in retribution for repeated attacks by the paladins of Lastwall, Arazni ruled the nation for centuries before escaping Geb and his kingdom in recent years. With Arazni gone and the king more certain than ever of Nex's imminent return, Geb has returned to active rulership of his kingdom. The morbid avenues of Mechitar throng with skeletal celebrants in public processions honoring Geb's renaissance, and the ghost-sovereign's agents in the outside world are known to be gathering rare ingredients for what appears to be a series of obscene necromantic rituals carried out on a massive ceremonial scale. Far from the melancholic recluse who sought a solution in suicide, Geb today prepares himself and his undying kingdom for a grand destiny."

Foreigners drawn to Jalmeray's unique sights are met by a {@condition friendly} and hospitable culture, making the island a popular destination for those who can afford and manage the journey. Ancient noble families, powerful mystics, and the esteemed masters of monasteries oversee the needs of citizens and visitors alike, playing lip service to the nation's monarch but in truth handling most day to day affairs themselves.",
						"While most of its population shares ancestral roots in Vudra, the streets of Jalmeray are walked by all manner of people and creatures, many of them visitors from distant lands. Genies and elemental beings remain from the island's ancient days, tasked with guarding cities and cultivating the natural beauty of the nation into a splendor known across the world. Generations of humans and genies living side by side have given rise to a large population of people known as geniekin, who carry a spark of elemental heritage within them. Garudas and nagas send emissaries to Jalmeray's monarch, while rakshasas and asuras hide among the cities to tempt the pious into ruin.",

Crueler still is the fate of those born with signs of taint from wicked asuras or rakshasas, as they are forced to work backbreaking and unsavory jobs such as cleaning sewage.",
						"Trade has made Jalmeray unthinkably wealthy, but the nation is best known for its learning and philosophy. Academics melds with religion, with temples serving as bastions of learning and libraries boasting richlyillustrated copies of holy texts. Thousands of shrines dedicated to thousands of gods offer written guidance on the many paths to attain enlightenment. Prestigious schools for every way and walk of life can be found within Jalmeray's cities, from magic to poetry to political intrigue and seduction. Jalmeray's famous monasteries, collectively known as the Houses of Perfection, export doctrines of physical, mental, and spiritual development across Avistan, Casmaron, and Garund.",
						"These Houses are also the center of Jalmeray's proud tradition of exemplary martial arts. Students from throughout the Inner Sea venture to Jalmeray to test themselves against the challenges offered by the Houses. Those who wish to prove their worthiness must succeed at a series of seemingly impossible trials against emissaries of the elements themselves: racing against the wind-swift speed of a djinni, wrestling the mountainous power of a shaitan, outwitting the flame-sharp wit of an efreeti, or performing other, similarly fantastical, tasks. Those elite few who complete these tasks are trained to push their bodies to the peak of physical and mental perfection, achieving spiritual balance and opening their minds to transcend the normal limits of mortal potential.",
						"Once every decade, the Houses of Perfection meet in {@condition friendly} competition in a grand tournament called the Challenge of Sky and Heaven. Students compete in the schools of historical knowledge, swordplay, unarmed fighting techniques, mastery of the self, arcane ability, and other esoteric disciplines. Thakur Kharswan and his vast legion of advisors known as the Maurya-Rahm sponsor additional contests, like the Solemn Sky Duel of Masters, which draws combatants not just from across the Inner Sea region but from all parts of the world."

Looming over the city's lesser stone buildings, the academy's ring of 10 terraced towers form Nantambu's heart, each decorated with a massive mosaic of one of the legendary Ten Magic Warriors. Students from around the world come to study in its storied halls, focusing primarily on the meticulous art of wizardry. Teaching styles within the school vary greatly; some professors teach only through didactic oral traditions, while others promote the study of ancient texts\u2014many penned by Old-Mage Jatembe and his disciples. The academy's teachers are notorious for sojourning in far-off lands and visiting scholars in other nations, meaning students must sometimes travel great distances to access particular mentors. The university also encourages fieldwork, and at any given time there are more tenured professors conducting research in the far corners of the world than in the school itself. Such professors often send their favorite students abroad to secure\u2014or uncover\u2014the ruins or artifacts they hope to study. In the Magaambya, it's said that a wizard learns both by reading and by doing\u2014a philosophy sometimes termed \"the Word and the Way\"\u2014and thus to shut oneself off from the world in perpetual study is at best counterproductive, and at worst miserly. In Jatembe's tradition, study is ultimately less important than using what you learn to serve others.",
						"The Magaambyan emphasis on service is the source of Nantambu's strength, with the resident mages ensuring that no invading force has ever managed to come within 20 miles of the city. This protection extends to neighboring villages as well, and despite no formal agreements of fealty, more than a hundred such settlements gladly and gratefully pay tribute to the city. Supported by the college's faculty, Nantambu's governing council of elected magistrate-mayors presides over the city and surrounding territory, using the famous {@i Watcher's Stone }of Nantambiyan Tower to keep magical tabs on Usaro and other threats in the region.",

With the fall of Sargava's colonial regime, however, some of that protection is gone, since the Free Captains who once made a tidy profit from Sargava's bribes now raid the waters around Senghor to compensate for their losses, making trade with former partners difficult.

To keep things agreeable between Senghor and the new nation of Vidrian, the two have cemented a very tentative alliance, the goal of which is to keep colonizers from retaking Vidrian and to prevent any possibility of such outsiders gaining influence in Senghor. The alliance also establishes several trade and naval agreements, with the terms benefiting Senghor more than Vidrian. The people of Vidrian were grateful for Senghor's help in their young nation's earliest days, but as it has grown into its independence its citizens have begun to protest the unbalanced terms of the deal. Vidrian's leaders are pressuring Senghor in hopes of reworking the terms of agreement, but Senghor has yet to give in to these demands, heightening tensions between the two powers."

While Iomedae's faith has not been outlawed in Cheliax following the Glorious Reclamation's defeat, it is watched much more closely, and its adherents have learned not to criticize the queen in even the mildest of terms.

The river and its support roads are key to Isger's regional importance, so most of its military is tasked with protecting the trade routes from bandits, monsters, and other dangers. Because travelers and merchants rely heavily on the Conerica and its trade roads, settlements along the river\u2014including the capital city, Elidir\u2014are not the isolated rural settlements their wooden buildings and quaint architecture might suggest. Although their pierced balusters, colorful glass-bead hangings, and brightly painted frieze boards give even the finest homes in Isger a rustic air, these towns are relatively cosmopolitan.",
						"Isger's hinterlands, however, have been less fortunate. Historically, Isger has always been something of an afterthought to its masters. Taldor and later Cheliax have held Isger as a vassal state, extracting its natural resources and talent while offering little in return. As a result, Isger has almost no industry, fortifications, or development outside the Conerica River's narrow band of prosperity. When the Goblinblood Wars of 4697 to 4701 erupted, they devastated a region that had no defense save valiant but badly overmatched local militias.",
						"The Goblinblood Wars saw hundreds of goblin tribes, led by ferocious and disciplined hobgoblin commanders, boil out of the Chitterwood and flood across Isger, destroying and devouring all in their path. Although the goblin horde was eventually driven back by an unprecedented alliance between the forces of Cheliax, Druma, and Andoran, the toll in lost Isgeri lives and wealth was enormous. Those losses continue to define much of the country. Thousands of Isgeri children were orphaned by the war, and their weak, war-ravaged government could not help them. The Church of Asmodeus stepped in to fill that need, founding a network of orphanages to cultivate its young charges in the Archfiend's unholy faith.",

There are even rumors that Isger's longserving steward, Hedvend VI, may soon be forced to abdicate his seat. Though Hedvend has always been a loyal right hand, House Thrune has expressed impatience with his incompetence and a desire to see Isger's throne occupied by someone more capable. This rumor has mostly been met with shrugs in Isger, where Hedvend is widely regarded as a Chelish puppet who has neither the interest nor the ability to help his own people.

From these hardships, a new strain of goblin leadership has emerged. Several goblin chieftains, brighter and longer-sighted than their predecessors, have formed an alliance between their tribes and made diplomatic overtures to nearby Isgeri settlements. Given that the war's wounds remain raw, the tribes' progress is slow, but they have established some mutual defense agreements with nearby towns, and they have begun to change how goblins are perceived in the region. Isger's rural towns and villages, accustomed to making their own decisions without any help from a disinterested central government, have found some of these goblins to be more reliable allies than their own nominal lords.",
						"This shift in relations is driven by need. Undead have long bedeviled this land, particularly in remote places such as Finder's Gulch and the plague-ravaged ruins of Gillamoor, where rotting and ravening zombies stalk through the crumbling houses of the dead. Urgathoan cults proliferate among blood-soaked battlefields and the blackened remains of torched villages, feeding on the fear and pain that still linger in those haunted sites. These malign forces have grown stronger and more numerous since the Goblinblood Wars and, some say, since Tar-Baphon's rise. Whether or not that rumor is true, it is certain that neither goblins nor humans can afford to ignore the rising tide of undead in Isger's hinterlands much longer."

Zon-Kuthon accepted their bargain, gifting the trio with cursed immortality as the Black Triune and sealing Nidal's fate ever after.

Additionally, because Nidal is the only civilization in the Inner Sea to have survived the destruction of Earthfall intact, it is a repository for lore that exists nowhere else in the world.

Under the leadership of Domina Jilia Bainilus, the former Lord-Mayor of Kintargo, Ravounel has threaded the delicate line between shoring up its own position as a regional power and maintaining cordial, if strained, relationships with its neighbors. Domina Bainilus must also preserve harmony between the various powers within Ravounel through diplomatic means, since she does not have the military strength to force compliance from her subjects and cannot afford to alienate any allies in the fragile new state. Although she has performed admirably so far, the difficulty of her position has increased as tensions mount between Cheliax and Andoran.",
						"Ravounel gained its independence by unusual and dramatic means. A rebel group, the Silver Ravens, uncovered a long-forgotten infernal document, the Kintargo Contract, and determined that its terms held a loophole that could be used to legally break House Thrune's grip on the Archduchy of Ravounel. The Silver Ravens deposed Paracount Barzillai Thrune, who had used his temporary seat in Kintargo to plot treason against his own house, installed Lord-Mayor Bainilus as the leader of this new nation, and worked to unite various factions within Ravounel behind her. Upon attaining office, Lord-Mayor Bainilus chose the title \"Domina,\" an old-fashioned honorific that had fallen into disuse after the Chelish Civil War.",
						"The choice of title was meant to signal both that Ravounel now stood outside House Thrune's hierarchy and that she intended to govern in keeping with old Chelish values\u2014which might be interpreted either as a subtle rebuke to House Thrune's perversion of those values, or an indication that she did not intend to repudiate Ravounel's Chelish heritage and connections. This ambiguity is deliberate, and characteristic of Ravounel's positions.",
						"Several disparate groups hold influence within Ravounel. First and foremost are the wealthy families of Kintargo, who control the shipping concerns, established industries, and domestic trade networks within the new country. Sea trade is particularly important, because the collapse of the Menador Gap has cut off land trade until Ravounel can clear the gap; this is an expensive and ongoing project, and it has spurred a certain amount of resentment toward the Silver Ravens, who won the nation's independence in part by deliberately destroying the pass to prevent Cheliax from attempting a military takeover. Now that invasion is no longer an immediate risk, many are second-guessing the costs that Ravounel incurred to prevent it.",
						"Other influential groups in the new realm include the aquatic elves of the Dismal Nitch, the strix of the Ravounel Forest, and the self-styled Kings and Queens of Vyre, the City of Masks. These last have kept Ravounel's government at a flirtatious distance, offering it sporadic and unreliable support without pledging any formal allegiance.

However, Ravounel's emerging status as a haven for escaped slaves has caused it quite a few headaches, as slave-hunters such as the Hellknight Order of the Chain demand the government's cooperation in apprehending fleeing slaves. An additional complication is that some Kintargan nobles, whose sympathies and business connections remain with Cheliax, have taken to kidnapping slaves and selling them back to the infernal empire.

				"The story of the Saga Lands begins well before Earthfall, when a band of exiles from the ancient nation of Azlant fled eastward and gathered here. Under the leadership of a man named Xin, these exiles founded the empire of Thassilon, which swiftly grew in power. It wasn't long before Xin's self-appointed governors, seven specialized wizards known collectively as runelords, turned against their king and assassinated him. The runelords then each seized control of one of Thassilon's nations, and in time they came to view each other as enemies. They enslaved giants to build staggering monuments, commanded dragons and monsters as specialized heroes and guardians, and ruled cruelly over the Varisian and Shoanti people whose land the runelords had claimed to build their empire.",
				"When Earthfall came, it devastated Thassilon as it did other parts of Golarion, yet the runelords had foreseen the looming catastrophe. Each developed their own solution to escape death from the apocalypse, but none of them appreciated the magnitude of the coming devastation. Though they had hoped to emerge from their shelters in the aftermath, they instead remained locked away for millennia, neither alive nor dead.",
				"In time, the legacy of Thassilon faded, and the rule of the runelords was remembered in oral traditions as something more akin to parable than actual history. The lands once dominated by the runelords were reduced to wilderness in which the survivors from Earthfall built up their own societies, while explorers and settlers from southern regions constructed cities over the ancient ruins.",
				"Today these lands host a wide range of peoples and cultures. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the right to rule and lead raids is determined by one's ability to defeat a powerful linnorm dragon in combat. East of this, in the nation of Irrisen, generations of witches descended from a legend hold the reins of rule, and winter is a constant presence. The Realm of the Mammoth Lords occupies the northeastern portion of the Saga Lands, past the reaches of the ancient Thassilonian empire, and is home to valiant warriors who ride megafauna into battle. In the southern extent, the frontier realm known as Varisia, once the heart of Thassilon itself, has seen new sagas to rival any that have come before.",

As if the act of conquering the land were all that mattered, she left its rule in the hands of one of her daughters, a cruel witch who was promised eternal youth in return for keeping the nation safe and secure. Every 100 years, though, Baba Yaga returned to reclaim the ruling queen, taking that daughter away to accompany her on her journeys to other worlds and leaving a new daughter installed on the throne.",

As the time of Baba Yaga's return drew near, Elvanna grew more and more convinced that she deserved to remain Irrisen's ruler forever. When her mother arrived, Elvanna triggered a devious trap and captured Baba Yaga, then turned her magic toward spreading the curse of winter to other lands. Only the timely intervention of a band of heroes halted her plot, freed Baba Yaga, and saw Elvanna's defeat. Today, for the first time since its founding, Irrisen is ruled by someone other than a winter witch, yet this should not necessarily be taken as a hopeful sign. Queen Anastasia may be young, but as an exile of the same world her ancient grandmother Baba Yaga hailed from, she has the potential to wield great power. Just how she will choose to exert this power in her stewardship over Irrisen has yet to be unveiled. Certainly, Irrisen is no safer a place today than it has been for centuries, and with rumbles of embittered witches who regard Queen Anastasia as the \"Fraud Queen,\" it remains to be seen if her rule will match the century-long reigns of her 14 aunts.",

Life in Irrisen has always been tough, and many still feel that the new queen's kindness is a cruel trick intended to grant hope only to rip it away just as the citizens start to trust again.

His defeat left his kingdom without a leader, although none found Opir's body among the dead in the battlefield.

However, the small town of Sandpoint may well be the most influential in the land, for not one but three legendary groups of heroes got their start from this coastal town. The first of these groups defeated Runelord Karzoug, while the second (of which Ostog the Unslain was a member) eventually traveled to distant Osirion before splitting apart to each forge their own stories throughout the Inner Sea region. The third group escorted local barkeep Ameiko Kaijitsu over the Crown of the World, where they aided her in reclaiming her birthright to become empress of the nation of Minkai.",

Events set in motion 10 years before by Runelord Karzoug's awakening came to a head as several other runelords rose and fought for dominance. One of the most powerful of their number, Runelord Alaznist, seized control of an ancient artifact that allowed her to manipulate time. If not for the intervention of yet another group of heroes with roots in Varisia, Alaznist would have transformed the Saga Lands into her own rune-blasted, devastated empire.",
						"All of these adventurers have left such a significant mark on the world that one could argue Varisia's most potent and important exports to the Inner Sea region are in fact its heroes. Yet Varisia also seems to produce no shortage of epic dangers that require equally epic solutions. Only time can reveal who might be the next great villains\u2014and their heroic counterparts.",

While Taldan influence is still heavy across the region\u2014from ethnicity and language to cultural traditions and even infrastructure\u2014the area was already home to many before Taldor's Azlanti progenitors settled here. Humans of the Kellid ethnicity, along with elves, dwarves, and gnomes, made their homes here in ages past, and their descendants remain to this day, having witnessed the rise and fall of heroes, empires, and even gods.",
				"Earthfall left its mark on this region, as it did on others. The elves, having some foreknowledge of the disaster, fled through their magical portals called {@i aiudara }to the realm of Sovyrian, leaving only a small number behind to eke out a living on the ruined world. It was during this time that the dwarves undertook their Quest for Sky, emerging from their underground homes to found the nation of Tar Taargadth\u2014and driving orcs onto the surface ahead of them. Not long after, gnomes fleeing some unknown terror from the First World arrived via planar portals, settling in this region's rich, wild woodlands. Only as humanity began to recover from the Age of Darkness did refugees from old Azlanti bloodlines join with local Garundi, Keleshites, and Kellids to carve out homes along the northwestern border of the Inner Sea. Centuries later, First Emperor Taldaris unified these city-states to found what would become Taldor, the largest human empire in Avistan.",
				"The thousands of years since Taldor's founding have shaped the region in countless ways. When Aroden became a god and raised the Isle of Kortos from the sea, his worship was centered in Taldor's capitol, Oppara. It was the Taldan Empire that led the Shining Crusade to resist and eventually imprison the Whispering Tyrant. But the empire was not infallible, and over time portions of the empire broke away. Elves returning from Sovyrian reclaimed Kyonin as their own, and the dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains retained their autonomy despite their own internal turmoil. Just how weak the empire had grown was revealed when its western holdings revolted, breaking off to become the empire of Cheliax in a relatively peaceful secession. The death of the god Aroden and the subsequent strife within Cheliax sparked further divisions, as the lands of Galt and Andoran, though partners in their succession from Cheliax and founded on similar philosophies, diverged in practice, with the latter establishing a functioning democracy while the former struggles in perpetual revolution. Even those lands that Taldor managed to retain have seen tremendous change over the centuries, most recently with the crowning of the realm's first grand princess.",

						"Perhaps due to its youth, Andoran keeps a close eye on its neighbors. Taldor's revitalization under Grand Princess Eutropia is not as welcome in Andoran as in other countries: despite Eutropia's many reforms and improved diplomacy, she's still a hereditary monarch who prevented a people's rebellion. Andoran has also taken note of Cheliax's recent weaknesses, and rumors abound that the two nations may be headed for war\u2014a sentiment encouraged by Andoran's leader, Supreme-Elect Andira Marusek, a retired general of the Steel Falcons known for her opposition to the Chelish slave trade.

These plains and forests were first home to one of the oldest Kellid cultures on Avistan, along with a sizable fey contingent in the central Palakar Forest. Once the dwarves emerged, the region became a holding of the Five Kings Mountains, remaining so until 2332 AR, when the signing of the historic Kerse Accord simultaneously ended 700 years of dwarven civil war, gained Druma its independence, and proved once and for all the economic mastery of the Prophets of Kalistrade.",

Technically, the Resplendent Bureaucracy\u2014a body of hundreds of civic administrators\u2014governs the nation, and membership in the Prophets of Kalistrade imparts no official governmental power. In practice, however, the tremendous financial resources under the Kalistocrats' control grant them more influence than that wielded by the official government. Furthermore, the Kalistocrats themselves are led by a High Prophet who legally has the authority to countermand the Bureaucracy's rulings. The current high prophet, Kelldor, leverages powerful divination abilities and a sharp acumen to all but predict the future, and has used his power to build relationships with the rulers of several Inner Sea nations.",

Formally the Mercenary League, the organization and its members are generally referred to as \"Blackjackets\" due to their iconic all-black uniforms. Given their status as the army of a nation of phenomenally wealthy traders, the Blackjackets are outfitted with the highest quality armor and weaponry and receive some of the best training\u2014and highest pay\u2014of any Inner Sea military. As a result, the Blackjackets' loyalty to the Resplendent Bureaucracy is legendary, and individual Blackjackets are decidedly and unhesitatingly amoral when carrying out their orders.",
						"The current power of the Blackjackets can be attributed to High Prophet Kelldor, who began building up the Mercenary League 2 years ago with an \"Edict of Preparation\"\u2014orders to nearly double the army's recruitment and training. The result has been an enormous force of highly skilled warriors with specialized training to combat orcs and undead, putting Druma in a unique position to weather the return of the Whispering Tyrant. As a result, the nation has not suffered as much as its neighbors from the rise of Tar-Baphon, though as lucrative trade routes have been choked off\u2014particularly along Lake Encarthan\u2014some citizens have begun to worry that the legions of undead may be a problem that not even money can solve.",

						"Dwarves first emerged onto Golarion's surface from the depths of the Five Kings Mountains. Looking out from those craggy peaks at an endless alien sky, their leaders understood for the first time just how tenuous and vulnerable their people would be in this strange land. Thus they built Highhelm, the first and greatest of their Sky Citadels, finding safety and familiarity in its stone halls and clever fortifications.",
						"From here, the kingdom of Tar Taargadth spread across the surface of Avistan, growing powerful and fruitful during the Age of Anguish. Yet it was not to last: in the millennia that followed, many subsequent Sky Citadels were lost or conquered, their territories increasingly invaded by orcs and humans, until in 1551 AR the kingdom finally collapsed. In its place rose the five fractious, smaller kingdoms that gave the mountain range its current name. These in turn fell to civil war and invasion, their communities growing small and insular. Today, the region still lacks a single central government, and while High King Borogrim the Hale convenes the Gathering Council among the region's leaders, and many dwarves across the Inner Sea region view the mountain range as an ancestral homeland, it's been over 250 years since the dwarves of these mountains could be said to be a single people.",
						"Despite this, the dwarves' longstanding traditions have given their society tremendous stability. In addition to resisting invasion from without, they've weathered their own struggles from within, most notably the societal decline following the eruption of Droskar's Crag in 3980 AR, during which much craft and culture was lost as the dwarves of the region turned to the worship of Droskar under Ordrik Talhrik. Since Ordrik's fall 250 years ago, the dwarves of the region have revived many of their ancient ways. Today, the Five Kings Mountains are the center of a growing dwarven renaissance, as Five Kings dwarves begin to reestablish contact with other dwarven nations isolated by the fall of Tar Taargadth, or adopt ancient dwarven magical practices such as those of the shamanic Rivethun. This newfound confidence in dwarven culture has also led to increased traffic with the neighboring elven realm of Kyonin, and the ensuing surge of collaboration between artisans continues to produce works of unparalleled beauty and function.",
						"The major settlements of Larrad, Highhelm, Kovlar, Taggoret, Rolgrimmdur, and Tar-Kazmukh have remained relatively safe and stable despite recent upheavals in nearby nations. Tradition and stability don't translate to ignorance or naiveté, though. The dwarves keep a wary eye on Tar-Baphon, the increased tensions between Cheliax and Andoran, the Ironfang hobgoblins, and even the newly established realm of New Thassilon. The cities here have maintained strong trade relations with neighboring nations, particularly mercantile Druma but also Andoran, Isger, and Taldor. Trade with Galt has largely ceased with that nation's fall into chaos, though some merchants have no qualms about selling equipment to the Gray Gardeners or resistance fighters.",

Elven experts' own experience and historical records suggest that it's only a matter of time before Tar-Baphon becomes an unavoidable threat to the entire region, and thus Kyonin's leadership has begun sending more diplomatic emissaries to other nations in preparation for a large-scale war that could ravage the continent. At the same time, this need for greater cooperation with other nations has led Kyonin's leaders to open their own carefully watched borders to ambassadors and visitors from a wide array of ancestries and nations.",

Still, the elven love of freedom means that many of these efforts are the acts of like-minded individuals rather than ruling institutions\u2014in truth, even the elves' current undertakings are less the result of a formal governmental order and more a collective drive among individuals to work toward the greater good. The fact that Kyonin's assistance is almost never a national decision, but instead the independent undertaking of numerous individuals, has given rise to the widespread opinion that elves as a whole care little for the other nations of Avistan. The recent destruction of Lastwall has rallied many younger elves into action, hoping to combat their nation's reputation for ambivalence as well as the Whispering Tyrant.",

Elves' apparent disinterest and detachment belie a keen eye on current events, a shifting political landscape, and growing and changing threats on a global and long-term scale. Even within the courts of Queen Telandia Edasseril, intrigue abounds as disparate factions vie for influence, and not all players agree with the decision to allow outsiders into the realm. Likewise, even this increased outreach has not overcome longstanding rivalries: Kyonin remains at odds with the River Kingdoms, especially regarding the human-occupied elven ruin of Sevenarches, and Razmiran's {@condition hostile} policy toward the elves has caused an ongoing cold war across the West Sellen River.",

								"The elves' long retreat to Sovyrian during the Age of Darkness may have saved their people, but their escape left their ancestral lands to rot and ruin. During their absence, the nascent demon lord Treerazer claimed much of Kyonin, twisting and perverting its sylvan majesty, culminating in an attempt to warp the Sovyrian Stone itself into a permanent portal to the Abyss. Fortunately for Golarion, this last atrocity was detected before it could succeed, prompting the elves to return to Golarion en masse in a ferocious counterattack. In the centuries to follow, elven forces drove the nascent demon lord from the heart of their realm, sequestering him in a vast swamp they dubbed Tanglebriar. Yet in spite of their migration back to the world they'd abandoned and their reforged ties with humanity and other nations, they've remained unable to destroy Treerazer completely or force him out of their lands.",
								"While few elves would say their conflict with Treerazer has been a success, most acknowledge that the threat the demon lord poses has been largely contained. Of late, elven forces have gained reinforcements as some crusaders from the Worldwound chose to join in the efforts against Treerazer rather than continuing south to confront Tar-Baphon, giving defenders renewed hope that victory may finally be within sight.",
								"The guardians of Tanglebriar cannot rest easy, however. Threats still creep from the swamp with deadly regularity, in the form of demons, dark fey, carnivorous fungi, and several cults that worship the nascent demon lord. Additionally, Treerazer is the son of the demon lord of fungus and parasites Cyth-V'sug, and though the two are estranged, the waning of Cyth-V'sug's influence in Fangwood Forest and the Worldwound has stirred fears that the two might reconcile. United, the two demon lords might have the strength to launch an offensive to take control of all Kyonin and beyond. Worse yet, either might form an alliance with Tar-Baphon, a possibility that has scouts and skirmishers on a perpetual lookout."

						"The empire's history of expansion, military might, and heroic glory are baked into its citizens' self-image, and even the lowliest peasant tilling Taldan soil takes pride in the fact that she's Taldan. Millennia of tradition have taken their toll on the realm, however, and the empire now holds only a fraction of the lands it once controlled. An ongoing, intermittent war with the neighboring satrapy of Qadira has instilled an anti-Keleshite and anti-Sarenite prejudice among many Taldans, and the nation's longstanding policy of agnatic succession, limiting the lines of succession to male descendants, has led to an unfortunately sexist trend in politics and society as a whole. The nobility's focus on prestige and personal power has consumed a disproportionate share of attention and resources, leaving the lower classes in increasingly dire straits and allowing the empire's once-magnificent infrastructure to slowly crumble.",
						"A recent and hotly contested transition of power in Taldor has begun to overturn some of these trends. Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian is the first woman to rule Taldor in the empire's history, following the Taldan Senate's vote to overturn the longstanding policy of limiting the crown to male heirs. Though still relatively new to the throne, Eutropia has already proven herself a formidable monarch with her wise arbitration and cunning diplomacy, upholding the proud and rich Taldan culture while.",

Yet the War for the Crown is still a fresh wound, and the old guard of Taldor has not yet fallen away. Many of Eutropia's former rivals remain in powerful positions and still oppose her rule, and plots and schemes circulate within every echelon of Taldan society.",
						"Taldor has long maintained an impressive military whose forces include the Taldan Horse, Taldan Phalanx, and Imperial Navy, but these assets have come to the fore with Tar-Baphon's move to claim Absalom\u2014itself not so far from Taldor's capital of Oppara. Nearly any Taldan can recount the nation's glorious leadership in the Shining Crusade and the victory the Taldan General Arnisant achieved there, and many in the nation view Tar-Baphon's return as an opportunity to once again shine on the field of glorious battle. Military outposts that not so long ago were devoted to skirmishes with Qadiran forces are now training troops for the potential return of the Whispering Tyrant, and the city of Cassomir has undergone a massive revival as the navy has begun building new ships at an unprecedented rate.",
						"Taldor as a whole maintains a close watch on neighboring lands. Some of this is handled through official channels, but a substantial portion of this work falls to the unseen hands of the secretive Lion Blades. Primarily recruited from Oppara's famous bardic colleges, Lion Blades specialize in infiltration, espionage, and even assassination to further their nation's goals. The Lion Blades' current leader is Dominicus Rell, who officially served as an advisor to the previous Grand Prince Stavian III and continues in that role for Eutropia, though rumor within the Lion Blades suggests a growing divide in agents' loyalty, with some favoring a senior agent named Laurisa Tromaine over Dominicus."
