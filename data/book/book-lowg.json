Perhaps you're a daring priest from the burning deserts of Qadira, blasting manticores and genies with the blazing light of the sun goddess Sarenrae, or a troll-hunting warrior from the icy Lands of the Linnorm Kings.

								"Millennia ago, the mighty Razatlan Empire spread across this vast continent, gobbling up weaker nations and marking its victories with vast pyramids. When the devastation of a meteor impact shattered the Razatlani civilization, the nations that were reborn from the wreckage found themselves forced to cooperate with each other to survive. Arcadia's myriad cultures have remained surprisingly peaceful and insular ever since, focusing their energy on the wellbeing of their citizens. From the engineers in the Land of Northern Lakes, who craft clever machines from unusually abundant skymetal deposits, to the hero-gods of Xopatl and the distant south, Arcadia's peoples both embrace a settled lifestyle among their terraced mountaintops and bayou stilt-houses and expand westward across the vast plains of a still lightly populated region. Most Arcadians remain suspicious of foreign cultures that are inclined toward conquest. Eager colonists from Avistan are thus restricted to a narrow strip of shoreline along the Grinding Coast, cordoned there by the Segada Protocol, which allows only those few exceptional individuals who have won the locals' trust to pass beyond the shielding mountains into the continent's interior."

In the north, danger\u2014and opportunity\u2014waits for adventurers over every hill in orc-ruled Belkzen and the demon-ravaged landscape of the Sarkoris Scar. The north's established nations are only marginally safer, from the rugged wilderness of Varisia and witch-ruled Irrisen to the shadowed moors of gothic Ustalav and sadistic Nidal. Avistan also has the distinction of being the center of several nonhuman cultures in the Inner Sea region, as dwarves attempt to reforge their lost empire in the Five Kings Mountains and elves guard the reclaimed lands in forested Kyonin that have been their stronghold since their return to Golarion after the Age of Darkness."

Its tunnels are inhabited by isolated tribes of xulgaths, deros, duergar, calignis, and other surface creatures who descended into the dark for safety and found themselves twisted by isolation and dark energies.

						"Thousands of years after Earthfall tore a rift across continents to form the Inner Sea, the legendary hero Aroden emerged from the darkness of history to claim his divine destiny. Using arcane power gathered over millennia, the last survivor of Old Azlant raised an otherworldly crystal, the heart of the weapon that slew his homeland, from the depths of the Inner Sea. Aroden's interaction with this alien gem, the {@i Starstone}, tested his character, and he emerged from the experience a living god. Immediately thereafter, he lifted the whole of the Isle of Kortos from the ocean depths and founded the settlement of Absalom at the site of his apotheosis to serve as the gathering point of his growing cult. He named the island Kortos\u2014\"Starstone\" in the ancient Azlanti tongue. Nearly 5,000 years later, despite the death of the god who founded it, this settlement has grown to become one of the largest metropolises on Golarion, known to many as the City at the Center of the World.",

Pilgrims came to Absalom from Osirion, Qadira, Taldor, and beyond to honor the city's mighty god-king, marvel at his seemingly impossible accomplishments, and strive to accomplish fantastic deeds of their own, many founding orders and institutions of esoteric learning that continue to the modern day.",
						"The swiftly growing riches of Absalom\u2014and the priceless jewel at its heart\u2014drew more than just pilgrims in those early days. Lured by far-flung tales of Aroden's ascension via the Starstone, the minotaur warlord Voradni Voon, conqueror of central Casmaron, plotted to wrest the stone from humanity's god and take his own place among the deities. Voon constructed the massive Brazen Gate upon the great eastern plateau of Kortos, and through it marched his horde of minotaurs, harpies, and centaurs from the distant land of Iblydos to Kortos, and thence to Absalom. Voon's attack, later remembered as the First Siege of Absalom, reached all the way to the walls of Azlanti Keep before being turned back by Aroden himself. The Last Azlanti pushed Voon and his army back to the plateau, wracking it with a series of powerful earthquakes that shattered the Brazen Gate and scattered the minotaur's forces. Voon's assault was but the first, however; would-be conquerors have besieged Absalom more than 100 times in the 5 millennia since the First Siege. Yet the city has never fallen.",
						"Not every would-be god came to Absalom with an army at their back. Over the years, at least three humans\u2014Norgorber (1893 AR), Cayden Cailean (2765 AR), and Iomedae (3832 AR\u2014used more subtle means to gain access to the Starstone Cathedral and use it to ascend to godhood. Their followings, as well as those cults dedicated to countless hopefuls who weren't so successful, added to Absalom's growing religious communities, with new temples attempting to make converts among the city's assembled religious truthseekers and fanatics.",
						"The Whispering Tyrant Tar-Baphon, an old foe of Aroden, is Absalom's most recent would-be conqueror, having launched a surprise attack on the city just 2 months ago in a bold assault that drew parallels to the initial siege of Voradni Voon. Adventuring heroes came to Absalom's defense, as they had so many times in the past, to defeat the lich-lord and send him back to the Isle of Terror. Absalomians are certain that the Tyrant will return again in the coming years with an even greater force of undead horrors, however. The only question is how many would-be conquerors will show up outside Absalom's walls between now and then."

In the island's earliest days, trees in the western Immenwood grew taller and faster than elsewhere on the island, and Kortos grew rich exporting wood to Qadira and the northern coast of Garund. The death of Aroden weakened the tower's magic, however, and now the harvested trees replenish at the normal rate\u2014perhaps even slower\u2014and the lumber barons of the Kortos Consortium look to druids in hopes of restoring the forest to its previous glory. The central Immenwood is older and craggier than the outskirts, prone to tangled undergrowth, an intertwined canopy, and long shadows. The forest's eastern reach touches the Tyrant's Grasp, where blighted trees grow warped and twisted by the necromantic corruption left by Tar-Baphon's defeat, and the clearings are haunted by undead wretches and sinister cultists of the Whispering Way.",
								"The Immenwood hides many ruins and lost settlements, along with several active fortresses. The wooded foothills of the Kortos Mounts hold mines, both active and inactive, almost all of which have inhabitants of one kind or another. Patrols of the First Guard's Eagle Garrison range the trails connecting the forest's settlements, which often fall prey to outlaws. The centaur tribes that dwell in the forest are more hospitable than their violent, xenophobic cousins of the Scrape, but they've suffered terribly at the hands of Absalom in recent years, and tensions remain high."

The plateau thundered with the hooves of 10,000 centaurs, whole tribes surging in vast interlocking circles to unleash a terrible earthquake upon Absalom, just as they had brought upheaval to so many of the ancient cities of Casmaron. Aroden reversed their seismic magic back upon them, killing Voradni Voon and shattering the Brazen Arch into a dozen jagged fragments. Countless centaurs toppled into deep rifts as the landscape cracked and seethed in violent destruction. After the rending of the Brazen Arch, the devastated eastern plateau became known as the Scrape. Most of the surviving minotaurs fled into the Riven Hills, where they harry Absalom and its allies to this day from their settlement at Hazrak. Voon's feral harpies, the last to give up the fight, fled to the highlands of the Kortos Mounts, and they have grown no more hospitable over the centuries."

When in port, sailors mix in Escadar's numerous barracks, saloons, gambling dens, and drug parlors.

A fall-fattened bear who appeared before hunters on the brink of starvation and a loyal war dog who saved a clan chief in battle might equally become honored huzuris after death. Once consecrated by the tribe's oldest witch, the huzuri became integral to the tribe's ancestor-based magic, and was often believed to be the repository in which the spirit of the tribe itself lived. Each successive witch and chief, upon attaining that title, pressed a fingertip soaked in their own blood to the bare skull. That crimson fingerprint stored its maker's memories, and so the collective history of the tribe was recorded in spirit-magic, blood, and bone.

Arable farmland in the region is limited to southern Brevoy, parts of the Sellen River basin scattered across Razmiran and the River Kingdoms, and tiny pockets in Mendev and Numeria.

Rostlanders, who have long believed their labor is exploited by the sly, clever-tongued Issians\u2014who are, after all, outright pirates before they were conquered by Choral\u2014grow increasingly frustrated by this perceived unfairness. Issia's merchant princes argue that they supply the ships and negotiate the trade agreements that bring wealth to all, and if they can't invest adequately in their shipping fleets, they risk losing trade to foreign rivals. Meanwhile, commoners' discontent and complaints about their taxes being \"stolen\" by Issia echoes ever-louder in their lords' halls.",

As Lander had been plagued with rumors of revolutionary sentiments since his youth, many nobles in Brevoy consider this to be simply one more way the lord has embarrassed his house, but the details of his supposed treason are muddled and contradictory. House Orlovsky in particular is adamant that the accusations are foul play on the part of the Surtovas, and the strain between the two houses, already pushed to the breaking point, has boiled over past the point of reason.",

Heroes from across Avistan and beyond answered the call to meet the demonic horde. As the years rolled into decades, however, and the hope of victory grew ever fainter, the once-bright crusade began to tarnish. Infiltrated by fiendish agents sowing treachery and paranoia, the crusade's inquisitors turned their tools against indigenous Mendevians, whose animist religions seemed suspect to the crusaders. On the front lines, the steady toll of battle forced commanders to accept recruits who were more often than not criminals and exiles driven by desperation rather than conviction.",

						"In addition to these difficulties, Mendev still contends with supernatural menaces. The sealing of the Worldwound did not eliminate the demons already on Golarion, and Mendev remains crucial as a staging ground for holy champions who have pledged to fight until the last fiend has been driven out. The frost-antlered shades of the Estrovian Forest and the cursed ruins of Icerift Castle, ignored during the war, remain threats as well.",
						"Yet this cold and perilous land holds wonder, too. Mendev's immense forests, white-crowned mountains, and snow-swept steppes are starkly beautiful. Scattered among them are the bones and dreams of dead generations, some who tried to tame an unyielding land and some who sought escape from the horrors of a seemingly endless war. All of them, and all their treasures, have vanished under snow and trees\u2014but not all are forgotten. Today, Kellids from the tribes of lost Sarkoris are returning to reclaim their devastated homeland. Some crusaders, hoping to atone for the cruelties inflicted by overzealous fanatics in the past, have sworn to help them. Knowing this, the surviving demons have taken to hiding their own soul-poisoning magics as relics of indigenous Sarkorian faith, as most outlanders cannot distinguish true relics from false ones."

						"Toward the end of the Age of Darkness, a great fireball with a smoking heart of steel broke apart in the night skies above Numeria, shattering into fragments\u2014some as small as fists, others large as cities\u2014that buried themselves across the rocky plains. These strange relics from another world beyond the stars have shaped life for the grim, survivalist tribes of Numeria ever since. Invisible emanations mutate the native animal and plant life into warped forms; horrors slumbering in cold chambers meant to voyage between the stars sometimes awaken and escape. Vast swaths of Numeria are cratered, irradiated wastelands populated by metal-clawed monsters with eyes of burning light. But skymetal and fragments of technology are powerful resources, and the lure of such wealth draws the brave and foolish alike.",
						"The native people of Numeria are hard-bitten Kellids, mostly hunters and herders with a dark, superstitious worldview shaped by their unforgiving land and its star-flung hazards. The fiercest warlord in each generation traditionally takes the title of the Black Sovereign and claims rulership of Numeria, but in practice most tribes have their own leaders and pay little heed to a far-off sovereign, believing only peasants and soft city folk bow their heads to such claims.",
						"This is particularly true for the current Black Sovereign, a once-mighty warrior named Kevoth-Kul, who conquered the city of Starfall in his youth. Some believed Kevoth-Kul would lead Numeria to glory on a red tide of conquest. Instead, he succumbed to the influence of the Technic League, a cabal of secretive arcanists and researchers obsessed with unlocking the secrets of Numerian technology. The Technic League plied Kevoth-Kul with the mind-altering fluids that seeped from the walls of Silver Mount, the vast and unimaginably complex edifice of alien technology half-buried in the earth outside Starfall. Soon the Black Sovereign was hopelessly addicted to these fluids, and lapsed into erratic, moody indolence.",
						"Recently, however, the Captain of the Technic League died under closely concealed circumstances. Brave souls whisper tales of a strange new goddess arising from the core of Silver Mount following the captain's demise, but the truth of these rumors is unknown. What is certain is that the Technic League fell into squabbling, murderous disarray within weeks. The survivors largely fled Starfall, and the Black Sovereign, freed from their control, has begun to break fitfully free from his addiction. Many fear that if he regains his senses, Kevoth-Kul will resume his campaign of conquest across Numeria. Since most Numerians have grown accustomed to semi-independence and no longer trust their tyrannical, unstable ruler, this is not a welcome prospect.",
						"The alternative, however, may be worse. While the Black Sovereign remained lost in his decades-long haze of intoxication, other warlords began claiming their own territories in Numeria. The collapse of the Technic League has greatly increased these warlords' power, as many former League members sought positions as advisors, and those new allies brought along their arsenals of stolen technology. Now, the warlords and their Technic League advisors are locked in an all-out arms race, each one vying to hoard the most powerful technology. While this has ensured that Numerian technology remains jealously guarded within the nation and does not reach neighboring lands, it also raises the risk that Numeria's civil war, if it comes, will prove devastating."

						"The oppressive theocracy of Razmiran, ruled by the masked priests of a masked god, has long been viewed with wariness by its neighbors. A young nation, Razmiran was carved out of the neighboring River Kingdoms only a little over 50 years ago. Yet unlike most of the short-lived countries that rise and fall in that tumultuous region, Razmiran seems grimly stable\u2014for it, unlike the kingdoms claimed by mere mortal lords, is ruled by a living god.",
						"Few have seen the living god, but Razmir's presence in his kingdom is inescapable. His masked priests maintain tight control over society, acting as enforcers more than spiritual guides. Their distinctive temples, which are always centered around a massive set of stone steps leading up to a gold or silver mask, stand in every village and market square. These steps represent the 31 steps Razmir is said to have undertaken to pass the Test of the Starstone and attain divinity, and they are a recurring motif in both theocratic rhetoric and the physical layout of Razmiran's public spaces.",
						"At present, Razmir's people take some solace in the constant reminders that they are personally protected by a deity. Soon after Tar-Baphon's resurgence and the destruction of Lastwall, Razmiran signaled that it would not oppose the Whispering Tyrant so long as the lich did not disturb the living god or his domain. This bargain appears to have been satisfactory to both parties, and thus Razmiran, alone among the nations bordering Lake Encarthan, appears poised to remain neutral in the coming conflict between Tar-Baphon and the other regional powers.",
						"Yet there are hints that this peace has been purchased at a ghastlier price than the priests acknowledge. Rumors persist that Razmiran is \"donating\" its dead to the Whispering Tyrant's armies in exchange for safety from the undead horde. These claims remain unconfirmed, in part because taboos concerning the uncleanliness of the dead are so strong in Razmiran that bodies are seldom viewed by family before being consigned to communal mausoleums, and in part because many of the dead are said to come from the massive prison mines of the Forgotten Track, where the condemned have disappeared quietly for years. Those who repeat these rumors often wonder, however, what might happen when Razmiran\u2014never an overly populous country\u2014runs out of corpses.",
						"Perhaps even more troubling are the cautious whispers from those near the clergy that Razmir himself has begun to act erratically, becoming oddly withdrawn from his priests. With the Whispering Tyrant a terrifying new threat in the region, this lapse in Razmir's attentions\u2014and perhaps his protection\u2014frightens his faithful. As of yet, however, this fear remains relatively unknown outside the most secretive circles in the capital city of Thronestep and the remote, sacred fortress of First Step.",
						"So far, everyday life in Razmiran has not drastically changed. The poor remain grindingly downtrodden, taxed nearly to starvation, while Razmir's clergy feast and indulge in every vice. In the wild Exalted Wood and the bustling crossroads town of Pilgrimage, outlaws and apostates dream of breaking the masked god's rule. That realizing these dreams may prove far more dangerous thanks to Tar-Baphon's rise does not dissuade them, for those crushed by tyranny are rarely able to see farther than the boot on their necks."

Now that the rip between worlds has been sealed and the demon lord Deskari slain, the scattered descendants of Sarkoris dare to dream of reclaiming their ancestral land, though the task that looms before them is forbidding.",
						"Despite Deskari's death and the scattering of his host, the northlands remain fraught with threats. Although the sealing of the Worldwound cut off the demons' never-ending reinforcements, it did not kill those fiends already present or purify the blight pervading the landscape. Most of the Mendevian Crusade's might has been redirected to face Tar-Baphon far to the south, and the holy crusaders who remain are no longer as numerous or as vigilant as they once were. The demon-haunted ruins of Storasta, Undarin, and Iz\u2014three Sarkorian cities that were overrun shortly after the Worldwound opened\u2014have each been reclaimed, but the prospect of rebuilding on such defiled sites was so daunting that the victors razed and abandoned them instead. For now, the soot-stained mines outside Iz and the murky Sarkora River, flowing over the rubble of Undarin, have been left to demons and the dead.",
						"Nevertheless, a small but courageous coalition of crusaders, adherents of the Green Faith, children of lost Sarkoris, and the old Sarkorian gods is determined to restore what it can. Their only permanent outpost is the small town of Gundrun, which they have built up into a walled and warded fort stockpiled with supplies. Otherwise, these self-proclaimed Reclaimers prefer a nomadic lifestyle. In part, this is because the witch-wardens and warriors of old Sarkoris viewed the wanderer's way as cleaner and nobler than the hierarchical life of towns, but the Reclaimers also favor nomadism because the Sarkoris Scar remains too dangerous to settle. Until more of the region has been purified, any attempt at large-scale encampment outside Gundrun seems profoundly unwise.",
						"Rather than rebuild cities, the Reclaimers focus on restoring wildlands. The mystical city of Dyinglight and its ring of aurora idols, and the repositories of ancient druidic traditions hidden deep in the Shudderwood, are two of their primary targets. However, both of these sites remain in corrupted hands: Dyinglight is surrounded by clans of fiendish, cannibalistic giants, while the Shudderwood's native fey have been corrupted into tormented and perverted forms. Even the wild animals who roam those lands show the lingering touch of the Abyss in their glowing eyes, unnatural stench, and rampant bloodlust. Still, the Reclaimers are making slow, painful progress. There is no safety in the Sarkoris Scar\u2014not yet. But for the first time in a long while, there is hope."

With the rise of Tar-Baphon hindering trade across Lake Encarthan, the Sellen River has become even more crucial to the cultural and economic lives of the nations it connects. Originating in the Lake of Mists and Veils, the river runs south through Numeria and the eastern River Kingdoms before serving as a natural border for many of Avistan's central nations, then spilling into the Inner Sea.

Grasslands and rich forests unfurl on the riverbanks, and outposts become more common.",

The river is too vast for anyone to completely control it, however, and smugglers, pirates, and cutthroats flourish along its less populated reaches. An entire secondary economy has sprung up to shield travelers from these threats, but it's an open secret that many river pilots and mercenary escorts switch sides to play pirate when their legitimate business slows."

The nation of Ustalav was free at last, although it never recovered the vigor that Tar-Baphon had stolen from it. Yet the Whispering Tyrant plotted within his prison. He learned he could use the shard still lodged in his hand as a devastating weapon, remotely detonating the other shards of the shattered shield. His agents\u2014a group of necromancers and death cultists called the Whispering Way\u2014stole the shards and placed them in key sites, including Lastwall's capital of Vigil and in the shadowed halls of Gallowspire. The Gallowspire explosion cracked the crusaders' great seal and freed the Whispering Tyrant. After setting loose hordes of undead across Lastwall\u2014now known as the Gravelands\u2014the lich moved against Absalom, determined to seize the power of the {@i Starstone}. Powerful heroes sacrificed themselves to detonate the shard in Tar-Baphon's own hand, staining the area now known as the Tyrant's Grasp with his necromantic power but forcing the Whispering Tyrant back to his phylactery on the Isle of Terror. The Whispering Tyrant now amasses his undead armies and prepares to ravage Avistan anew."

						"Cartographers may designate the lands between the Tusk Mountains, the Kodar Mountains, and the Mindspin Mountains \"Belkzen,\" but there is no such formal nation and few of its mainly orc residents would deem it a place name. To them, Belkzen is the name a legendary hero, an orc warlord who united the tribes in the area and conquered the dwarven Sky Citadel of Koldukar more than 8,000 years ago. Belkzen renamed the city Urgir, and it remains the largest city in the region by far. Although Belkzen's alliance collapsed after his death, fracturing the orcs into dozens of feuding tribes, Urgir remains a symbol of power to the them, and despite constant turnovers in leadership the city has continued to grow. More recently, a clever and far-sighted warlord named Grask Uldeth, chieftain of the Empty Hand tribe, saw the economic benefits other nations enjoyed and sought to bring them to Urgir by means other than by simply stealing them. Uldeth created a system of tokens allowing non-orcs to travel through Belkzen freely in exchange for tribute payments, encouraged merchants to relocate to Urgir with light taxes and complete indifference to unscrupulous wares, and ensured their protection in the city with a rudimentary police force called the Closed Fist. Uldeth was slain by a mysterious assassin in 4716 and his steward, Ardax the White-Hair, now serves as Overlord of Urgir. Ardax leads the Closed Fist but not the Empty Hand, which has given him more time to coordinate improvements to the city. Chief among these has been the discovery of several caches of dwarven weapons underneath the city, along with a huge herd of rust monsters that now patrol with the Closed Fist like trained dogs.",
						"When the Whispering Tyrant broke free from Gallowspire, he sent several envoys to regain the allegiances of the orc hordes, just has he had 15 centuries ago. The tribes of Belkzen remembered what had happened to their ancestors under Tar-Baphon, however, and this time the orcs refused to fight and die for the lich-king. The orcs slaughtered the undead envoys as an answer and mounted the envoys' heads on the walls of Urgir. The Whispering Tyrant was enraged by this defiance, sending an army of undead to cow the orcs in response. In the Battle of Nine Broken Skulls outside of Urgir, Ardax led a desperate coalition of orc tribes to victory over the undead army. The Whispering Tyrant had sought to break the orcs' morale, but he succeeded only in teaching them how much stronger they could be together.",
						"The orcs know it's only a matter of time before the Whispering Tyrant sends a larger force or, worse, marches to Urgir personally. While even the most stubborn of the tribes have conceded they must solidify into a united front to repel this incipient threat, they struggle to overcome a long history of strife. Belkzen's land is harsh and unyielding, and it receives little rain except during the spring floods that turn the region's largest thoroughfare\u2014the Flood Road\u2014from a wide, dry valley into a river. The orc tribes now struggle to work together to share the resources of their hard land, and fiercely debate whether to reach out to long-despised neighbors for aid against the Whispering Tyrant's wrath. Orcs who aren't warriors have used this trying time to gain influence and prestige, both due to their skills at managing resources and their relative neutrality in orc tribal grudges. For the first time in millennia, Belkzen's orcs value caretakers, artisans, and negotiators\u2014not just its warriors."

						"The Fangwood is an ancient forest, populated by fey in the ages before Earthfall. When dwarves and Kellid wanderers discovered the Fangwood, they found it rich in resources. The fey, disturbed by these unfriendly intruders, rallied behind Gendowyn, an ancient, powerful, and capricious fey noble. Gendowyn used guile and trickery to repel the intruders, and before long, the dwarves had withdrawn and the Kellid settlers declared the forest taboo. Gendowyn then reached out to her chastened neighbors, forming strong alliances that lasted for thousands of years.",
						"Yet treachery lurks even among the fey, and one of Gendowyn's handmaidens, Arlantia, had secretly devoted herself to Cyth-V'sug, the demon lord of fungus and parasites. In 4062, over 200 years after the end of the Shining Crusade, Arlantia overthrew and imprisoned Gendowyn before releasing a terrible plague throughout the northern Fangwood: a supernatural infection called the Darkblight. This plague spread quickly among the fey, warping their features and twisting their souls. The Darkblight's expansion was slowed by Nirmathi scouts in the Fangwood, who fought to protect their forest homes from the infection, and finally ended in 4717, when heroes from Nirmathas slew Arlantia and freed Gendowyn from her imprisonment.",
						"Today, Gendowyn rules from her Accressiel Palace in the heart of the Fangwood, but her rule is far from secure. Pockets of the Darkblight remain, and the dense northern section of the Fangwood is home to orcs, dragons, and other threats that murder fey on sight. Keenly aware of her need for allies, Gendowyn has established relations with the Nirmathi and the druids of Crystalhurst, particularly the scouts and freedom fighters called the Chernasardo Rangers. Still, relations between fractious humans and fickle fey are strained even at the best of times, and both sides welcome intermediaries skilled with negotiation or primal magic."

Although the crusaders still found purpose in fighting to contain the orcs of Belkzen, many knights believed their organization's glory days were behind them. Their vigilance and zeal gradually dwindled.",

In the devastating summer of 4719, Tar-Baphon obliterated the village of Roslar's Coffer and the crusader capital of Vigil. At the same time, Whispering Way cells throughout Lastwall synchronized murders, arson, and undead uprisings that shattered the nation. In one season, Lastwall was broken. Lastwall's ruler, Watcher-Lord Ulthun II, was forced to retreat to Absalom.

Most of Lastwall's population has already fled, and only the truly desperate remain huddled in crumbling strongholds or on failing farms. To travel openly across the Gravelands is to court death, but the surviving Knights of Ozem\u2014now called the Knights of Lastwall\u2014seek to stem the tide of evil, even in the face of incredible odds. Legendary crusader fortresses such as Castle Everstand and Castle Firrine stand empty, abandoned when their defenders could no longer count on supplies or support.

Although the lake harbors pirates and monsters, the opportunity for profit makes navigating its waters worth the risks.",

This large island at the lake's center was never a place visited by the sensible. Strange storms whipped the lake for miles around it, and the island's rocky shores provided few safe places to anchor. Now that the Whispering Tyrant has returned, the negative energy storms around the island roil constantly, and the island contains an even greater undead presence. Unlike in the Gravelands, where mobs of undead roam under the guidance of undead officers or Whispering Way necromancers, the undead on the Isle of Terror are almost all powerful individuals who serve in Tar-Baphon's courts and aid him in his plot to scour the lands of the living.

Deep in the Three Furies yawn the Wizard-King's Pit and its Well of Sorrows, a trap that Tar-Baphon set for Aroden millennia ago. The trap is rumored to still be active and poised to snare careless explorers.",
						"Not all inhabitants of the Isle of Terror are beholden to the Whispering Tyrant. The terror wolves that prowl the island's forests are a threat to any travelers, and the living trees in the Shadow's Heart forest bear a passionate animosity toward all intruders. A powerful undead dragon named Karamorros hides on the island, fuming and plotting. Karamorros had planned to murder Tar-Baphon due to an old vendetta, but her hasty attack on the returned Whispering Tyrant recently led to a humiliating rout. Although Karamorros and her minions, the Whisperscale lizardfolk, might serve as allies for those who wish to confront the Whispering Tyrant, she is every bit as crafty and wicked as her enemy.",

						"The imperialistic and territorial nation of Molthune was merely a province of Cheliax until it declared its independence\u2014and its willingness to fight to keep its sovereignty\u2014in 4632 AR. To solidify control within its borders, the Molthuni established a military oligarchy of nine general lords and created a burdensome series of taxes to fund a standing army. While the elite in the southern cities of Canorate and Korholm benefited from these measures, the northern territories found the taxes onerous and, in 4655 AR, rebelled to form the fiercely independent nation of Nirmathas. Since then, Molthune has warred with Nirmathas to reclaim its lost territory, with the conflict alternating between bloody combat and uneasy cease-fire.",
						"This dynamic has changed only recently with the creation of the new hobgoblin nation of Oprak and the reemergence of the Whispering Tyrant, which have forced Molthune to cool many of its military operations on the Nirmathi border. The crushing defeat of northern Molthune's forces by the hobgoblin General Azaersi, though officially derided as the fault of the commander in charge and not a reflection of Molthune as a whole, caused a great deal of soul-searching and finger-pointing among the higher echelons of Mothune's government. The rise of the Whispering Tyrant has widened these divisions further, as some generals recognize that the current threat requires alliances to survive, while other generals believe that crushing Nirmathas, Oprak, and Tar-Baphon single-handedly is the only way to regain face after being humiliated. Pragmatic-minded Molthuni diplomats and merchants have been making tenuous connections with their counterparts in Nirmathas, although bellicose spies and saboteurs frequently infiltrate these delegations. Only time will tell if Molthune will ally with other nations against the Whispering Tyrant, or doom the entire region out of pride and shortsightedness.",
						"Residents of Molthune have, traditionally, been divided into imperial citizens and indentured laborers. Although indentured laborers cannot vote and have their travel and trade limited to specific regions within the nation, they can\u2014as of 4710\u2014ascend to citizenship with 5 years of military service or some other, regulated service to the state. Immigrants are also eligible, and Lastwall refugees have flocked to Molthune as a result. Proof of earned citizenship comes in the form of a large iron coin with a number and the red flag of Molthune upon it; those who have \"earned the red coin\" are often unpopular with the aristocratic elite but have swelled the ranks of the Molthuni military forces. Molthune also makes use of mercenary companies, both human and \"monstrous,\" though this practice has come under heavy criticism after General Azaersi made use of Molthune's resources to raise the Ironfang Legion and start the Ironfang Invasion.",
						"Despite its militaristic leadership, Molthune pursues diplomatic relations with those neighbors it cannot easily subjugate, including the economically powerful Druma and the Cheliax-backed nation of Isger.

Now, the destruction of Lastwall and incursion of the Whispering Tyrant's undead forces have put Nirmathas in a keenly precarious position.

Its leader, General Azaersi, first rose to prominence as the commander of one of Molthune's non-human mercenary companies. She patiently attracted hobgoblins and other monstrous mercenaries to her side, ultimately swelling her troop into an army. When she had taken all the recruits Molthune could offer, she broke with Molthune and led her army into Nirmathas. With the aid of a powerful artifact called the {@i Onyx Key}, Azaersi and her troops made their base in a strange castle deep within the Plane of Earth called the Vault of the Onyx Citadel. From there, she could create dimensional pathways to any location she chose, allowing the Ironfang Legion to move supplies and troops with ease.",
						"Azaersi's legion rapidly conquered much of southwestern Nirmathas, and she would have extended her domain further if a group of heroes had not raised a militia to halt her advance. The militia commanders eventually confronted Azaersi in the Onyx Citadel and convinced her that her relentless warmongering would bring nothing but destruction to her people. Exhausted by the toll the war had taken on her army, her friendships, and herself, Azaersi elected to withdraw her troops into the mountains and use the Onyx Citadel to establish Oprak as a homeland for hobgoblins and other creatures seen as monsters.",

The general and her advisors\u2014the Enclave Council\u2014were careful when drawing their borders to exclude the dwarven free city of Kraggodan, but Azaersi all but dared her neighbors to contest her claim. Representatives from the Umbral Court of Nidal were the first to meet with Azaersi and acknowledge the hobgoblin general's sovereignty, agreeing to a 3-year nonaggression pact. Shortly thereafter, Forest Marshal Dardinna Yallis of Nirmathas approached Azaersi under heavy guard to discuss diplomatic relations, and agreed to peace for 4 years. Yallis hopes that because the hobgoblins are scheduled to end their peace with Nidal first, they will look west rather than east for military conquests.",
						"General Azaersi maintains the military arm of her nation\u2014still called the Ironfang Legion\u2014but has solidly shifted her nation's focus to developing a robust economy. Due to the extraplanar nature of the Onyx Citadel, Oprak is currently the safest nation in the region from the threat of the Whispering Tyrant, and Azaersi is currently avoiding military conflict in order to fully develop her new homeland's resources and tactical advantages. Hobgoblins and other creatures willing to serve as explorers, miners, smiths, and alchemists have been flocking to the fledgling nation.",
						"Although Oprak is little more than three hundred miles across and consists primarily of forbidding mountains, the hobgoblins have substantially more resources than they have revealed to the rest of the world. The Onyx Citadel rests in a large, verdant cavern that the hobgoblins call the Onyx Vault, which is even larger than the territory Azaersi claims on Golarion. Created long ago by a powerful species of terraformers called xiomorns, the Onyx Vault has a variety of terrain, its own day and night cycle, and even clouds and rain. The hobgoblins are industriously taming this strange land, negotiating with powerful elemental natives, and mining the profusion of gems and ores in the wondrous place.",
						"Golarion's connections to the Onyx Citadel\u2014paths known as the Stone Roads\u2014are guarded by legions of watchful hobgoblins. Five such entrances exist throughout the mountains of Oprak, the largest being the obsidian tower in the new capital Hunthul's heart.

Crafted over millennia by elemental might, the wish magic of bound genies, and the occult calculations of esoteric mathematicians, the empire rules unchallenged over several major trade routes, though its control dwindles northward among the nomadic horse tribes of the Windswept Wastes. Though the imperial line has never been broken, the current monarch, Kalish XXII, is already in his nineties, and many fear civil war between his numerous heirs when he finally dies."

						"The vast deserts of Garund's northern coast may look inhospitable, but it was here along their rugged shorelines and fertile rivers that human civilization first rebounded from the devastation of Earthfall.",
						"For a thousand years, humanity huddled in small bands and villages, eking out a bare existence under an ash-clouded sky, rarely organizing beyond localized trade networks. Then came the Jistka Imperium, clever artificers who rose from the deserts of what is now Rahadoum. The Imperium conquered the neighboring peoples and forced the desert dwellers in north-central Garund to form a defensive federation called the Tekritanin League, matched also by the rise of powerful Ancient Osirion in the east. In the ensuing conflict between these three nations, Osirion eventually ended up victorious through a combination of astute politics, magic, and brute military force, its god-kings conquering both of the neighboring empires. But Ancient Osirion eventually met its end as well, finally collapsing under the weight of its own hubris. Keleshite agents from Qadira, a vassal of the vast Padishah Empire of Kelesh just across the Obari Ocean, took advantage of this decline. These agents destabilized the region until Qadira could sweep in and \"rescue\" Osirion from disaster, turning it into a Keleshite colony. This foreign rule in Osirion lasted for more than 3 millennia before Khemet I, dubbed the Forthbringer, drove the Keleshite government from its shores and returned Osirion to sovereign rule by a Garundi pharaoh.",
						"While this chaos played out in the east, things were going equally poorly in the west. Spread by Keleshite immigration, the worship of Sarenrae hit the city of Azir and other major settlements like an avalanche, meeting violent resistance from local followers of Nethys and Norgorber. The resulting Oath Wars devastated the region for more than 60 years before Azir's militia ended the conflict by burning all temples and establishing a fiercely secular nation, which they dubbed Rahadoum. Meanwhile, south of Osirion, Sarenite refugees and bandits carved settlements out of arid and sparsely populated plains, guarded from marauding bands of gnolls by the legendary janni heroes called the Templars of the Five Winds. It was only with the arrival of the alien Pactmasters and their laissez-faire, plutocratic governance that this new nation of Katapesh came into its own as a hub of worldwide trade.",
						"Today the nations collectively dubbed the Golden Road are a study in contrast. In their bustling, cosmopolitan cities, markets overflow with curiosities from across the world, while scholars advance the frontiers of magic and science in buildings older than many northern nations. Yet at the same time, settlements remain largely restricted to coasts and rivers, leaving huge stretches of land untouched, ceded to deadly monsters and those bold adventurers willing to brave them. In these sun-drenched dunes ruled by scorpions, genies, fiends, and sphinxes, heroes find their fortunes\u2014or are swallowed forever."

In Osirion, the mountain monastery of Tar Kuata houses monks and scholars of Irori as well as an order of elite dwarven martial artists called the Ouat. A sect of druids called the Stonewardens patrols the central range near Thuvia, guarding hidden sanctuary valleys and remote portals to the First World, while the legendary alchemist Artokus Kirran built his citadel among the peaks, using their slopes as his first line of defense.",

Among its rubble, marids and monstrous humanoids battle over priceless sites including the Fields of Glass, the Domes of the Polymatum, and the Pit of Endless Night. Lesser-known sites in the range include the Cathedral of Claws, the Tagas Labyrinth, and the lair of the undead dragon Arantaros. Among the northern Mwangi peoples, adventuring scholars search for the Earthspear, a spiraling repository carved into the heart of a mountain. The Earthspear is said to hold writings from Old-Mage Jatembe himself, protected in case of a second apocalypse.

In Katapesh, those with the gold make the rules, and the only question is whether one can afford their desires.",

Fleeing south from pogroms in Osirion, these devout settlers founded two cities that would eventually become Solku and Katapesh. Yet life was hard on Katapesh's plains, and constant assault by gnolls, bandits, and destructive sandstorms led subsequent generations away from the faith, seeking salvation in something more concrete.",

Trade boomed as residents of the Inner Sea region clamored for the new drug, and with the influx of money came warring gangs and pesh dens full of helpless addicts. As the economic boom and influx of foreign trade allowed local merchants to expand into other wares, the fundamental anarchy of a drug-fueled economy continued under a loose consortium of corrupt merchants and outright criminals.",

Seven feet tall, robed and masked to hide their forms, the Pactmasters arrived from parts unknown and took control of the city of Katapesh\u2014and by extension the nation\u2014in a bloodless coup that no records can explain. Though they didn't end the city's freewheeling approach to trade, they stabilized and formalized it. Under their guidance, usually filtered through humanoid mouthpieces like Pactbroker Hashim ibn Sayyid, the nation has become perhaps the largest black market in the world, its independence maintained by economic ties and a constabulary of metal constructs known as aluums.",

Gnoll slavers, nomadic gnomes, and dwarves from mines in the Brazen Peaks rub shoulders with visitors from far-off lands such as rakshasas from Vudra or even immortal traders from the Great Beyond. Although Katapesh has a bustling slave trade, slavers who deal in the business consider keeping track of one's property a personal responsibility, so those who manage to escape slavery often find it easy to set up new lives among the city's throngs of traders, fugitives, and expatriates.",

There, the ruins of Tumen, Osirion's former capital, buried by sandstorms after the death of the Four Pharaohs of Ascension. For every known site of legend, a dozen more lie undiscovered. Upon taking the throne, the Ruby Prince, Khemet III, briefly invited foreign scholars and archaeologists to explore these sites, advancing his goal of raising Osirion's profile while learning more of the secrets behind the ancients' miracles. But after both the disastrous return of the Sky Pharaoh a few years ago and uncovering the secret machinations of the Night Heralds hidden among the area's sites, the prince has attempted to restrict access once more, succeeding only in driving the thriving tomb-robbing business underground. The elites of other nations now have developed a desire for Osirian relics.

						"Long ago, the high deserts of Qadira were home to nomadic herders who mingled with local genies and elementals, giving rise to a large population of geniekin. Even today it's not uncommon for geniekin to be born to parents who may have otherwise had no idea of their elemental ancestry. Qadira's early inhabitants created little in the way of permanent settlements. When the armies of the Padishah Empire of Kelesh rolled west into the region, seeking a trade port along the Inner Sea, these scattered bands had little choice but to assimilate into their conquerors' society.",
						"By far the invaders' greatest influence on the region was the introduction of their Keleshite empire's patron goddess, Sarenrae. With her dervishes wielding healing light and righteous steel, the Dawnflower spread across the Inner Sea like a grass fire, finding legions of converts while sparking wars in northern Garund. This dichotomy between healing and harm was felt even within Qadira itself, where Sarenrae's faith is the state religion, as the goddess's emphasis on forgiveness clashed with Kelesh's expansionist tendencies. Most recently, the church's push to abolish slavery\u2014a crusade that seems poised on the brink of victory\u2014has made its priests unwelcome in slaving ports like Sedeq, where bottled djinn, shaitans trapped in amber, humanoid prisoners, and caged monsters all line the slave block.",
						"As the point of Kelesh's spear, Qadira earns little love from its neighbors. Nobody inside or outside its borders has forgotten the way the empire swooped in to annex Osirion for millennia, or its centuries of brutal warfare with Taldor to the north. Of late, the rise of Grand Princess Eutropia as a strong ruler in Taldor has forced Satrap Xerbystes II to quiet his saber rattling. While the prideful satrap might wish otherwise, final command of the nation's armies belongs not to him but to his vizier Hebizid Vraj. Hebizid was appointed by the Padishah Emperor himself and able to overrule the satrap, should Xerbystes make decisions against the empire's interest. The satrap focuses instead on economic victories and defending the hundred stone watchtowers along the contested border. He satisfies his martial desires with the Peerless, a hand-selected group of heroes who undertake impossible missions into the nation's wild places for their monarch's glory and entertainment.",
						"Ordinary Qadirans are just as proud as their leaders, and with good reason: each day they see their shores flooded with visitors who gape at the marvels of the Keleshite empire, from its animated siege engines and flying carpets to bands of genie mercenaries and great elemental-powered sandships that sail the dunes on phantom winds. Caravans arrive daily in Katheer, showcasing creatures and knowledge unseen in the west, and the Venicaan College of Medicaments and Chirurgery blends magic and medical science to train the greatest healers for thousands of miles. Most Qadirans are legendarily persuasive, confident, and concerned with luxury and status, yet also honorable and generous. Hospitality is both sacred and formalized, with breaches of etiquette risking deadly feuds. Even criminals observe these codes of conduct.",
						"Outside of the great caravan cities, Qadiran settlements are small and must defend themselves against feral giants, draconic beasts, angry elementals, and the other creatures of the desert. Sometimes residents are able to live in harmony with these strange creatures, such as in the scholarly enclave of Gurat, where a cyclops prophet called the Mouthpiece speaks invaluable truths to the satrap and is guarded by a thousand deaf soldiers. Legends also speak of independent settlements of geniekin high in the Zho Mountains, still resisting the empire's control. Though the settlements are hidden by powerful illusion spells, adventurers occasionally stumble across them, or they may reveal themselves to the worthy in moments of need. The more common outcome for adventurers, however, is finding only ruins, like those of Al-Bashir, whose resident harpies devour unwary caravans, or of lost Shadun, where shadows with burning eyes walk the ashen streets. Most practical caravan leaders headed through Qadira's deserts hire plenty of guards, making the nation a popular destination for both foreign mercenaries and elite local sellswords."

A child of the chaos that followed the collapse of Ancient Osirion, Artokus met with local leaders and concocted a plan to use the vast wealth generated by the elixir to help his fellow downtrodden nomads. Artokus would remain a hermit, secreted in a hidden and heavily defended citadel in the Barrier Wall. Each year, he would send forth a blind, mute servant bearing six vials of the elixir.

To the east, the city of Aspenthar is more dour, with its scheming Prince Zinlow requiring all citizens to join the military reserves in what many expect to be an eventual attempt to conquer the other cities, or perhaps kidnap Artokus himself.",
						"On the Junira River that marks the border with Osirion lies Lamasara. The city is a port of pleasures, dedicated to artists and hedonists of all sorts and popular with tourists even in its off years thanks to the savvy policies of Queen Zamere. The isolated city of Duwwor, by contrast, has little interest in outsiders, and its citizens are devoted to living in harmony with the land. Boasting an immense temple to Gozreh and closely allied with a circle of desert druids, Duwwor is home to the best guides in the nation, taking scholars and adventurers deep into the dunes in search of the ruins of the Tekritanin League. Just as famous are the windmills that adorn Duwwor's buildings and fields, harnessing the desert winds to power ingenious constructs and industry.",
						"Smallest of the great cities is Pashow, dedicated to Nethys and organized around arcanists studying or teaching at the Scrollspire, the magical university built atop the entrance to an ancient Tekritanin library-well. Pashow's isolation makes it vulnerable to raids by the Water Lords, nomadic warriors who inhabit the nation's trackless interior, and the Scrollspire regularly shelters townsfolk within its walls.",
						"Of the numerous monsters that hunt Thuvia's wastes, the most feared are the fiendish divs. Long ago, the div demigod Ahriman dwelled in Thuvia's heart, called there by the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues and housed in the vast magical palace known as the House of Oblivion. While Ahriman was eventually driven back to Abaddon, his murderous divs lurk throughout the desert, served by nihilistic cultists called the Usij."

						"The seas surrounding Avistan and Garund are rough and lawless places. Controlled by no nation, the Arcadian Ocean teems with pirates and raiders, from the Free Captains of the Shackles to the dragon-headed longships of the Linnorm Kings. Since gaining control of both sides of the Arch of Aroden\u2014the massive ruined bridge across the Hespereth Strait between Avistan and Garund\u2014Cheliax's navy has limited these brigands' access to the Inner Sea, yet that by no means makes the seas safe. Okeno's yellow-sailed slave galleys engage in a perpetual and bloody game of cat-and-mouse with Andoran's abolitionist Gray Corsairs, and plenty of other homegrown threats hunt the depths. Yet despite the danger, the waterways of the Inner Sea region are crucial to trade. Merchant fleets of all sorts travel its sea lanes, carrying goods and travelers between neighboring nations or setting off for the far side of the globe.",
						"Most nations with a coastline have some sort of navy, but a few stand out as particularly noteworthy. Constantly at each other's throats, Andoran and Cheliax have the two largest fleets, their warships forever harassing each other but keeping just short of actions that would tip them into outright war. Once an equally formidable power, Taldor's navy is only recently being built up again after dwindling for several decades, though it still runs a legendary shipyard that can build a warship in a single week. Absalom maintains a significant fleet, aided by gillmen and the unique hippocampus-mounted cavalry called Wave Riders. As the most valuable port in the Inner Sea, Absalom has been forced to call on its navy many times to maintain its independence, yet it follows the lead of most other nations and restricts itself to strictly defensive operations. Fleets on the Arcadian Ocean tend to be much smaller, with the Free Captains dominating the southern waters and Cheliax guarding the northern ones, though nations like Rahadoum and even individual cities like Magnimar and Korvosa need to maintain significant defenses against ocean-going raiders and the plethora of monstrous threats lurking beneath the waves.",
						"Since the demise of Azlant during Earthfall, crossing the Arcadian Ocean has been considered madness by many Inner Sea residents, with Arcadia itself a half-believed legend. Tales of bold adventurers raiding the shattered isles of Azlant for the fantastic treasures lingering in its half-drowned ruins have been staples of storytellers since Aroden first led survivors to the mainland. In recent years, news of state-sponsored overseas colonies have begun capturing popular imagination. Still, for most sailors in the region, the Arcadian Ocean might as well represent the western edge of the world. The vast majority of traders never leave sight of land\u2014and those who do are often persuaded of their folly by merfolk, sea devils, brine dragons, and other predators of the deep ocean."

						"Inner Sea legends often place any sufficiently marvelous location in the ruins of Azlant, and the truth is that even after millennia of degradation, the actual sites uncovered by explorers are every bit as magical as their legends. Much of the Inner Sea region's initial knowledge of the lost empire came from famed Pathfinder Durvin Gest. Delving into an Azlanti sea stack temple called the House of Aeons, he discovered not just a vast trove of magical {@i aeon stones} but a giant metal book called the {@i Infalabulum} that described many of the empire's wonders and their locations, guiding both Gest's future explorations and those of the Pathfinder Society.",
						"The most marvelous of Azlant's ruins is its former capital, the City of Golden Gates. Said to be literally the perfect city, granted by Abadar as an example to the Material Plane, the hillside metropolis was destroyed by a direct strike during Earthfall; its Imperial Palace and Throne of Glass shattered, and much of the city sank beneath the waves. Today, the underwater portions of its ruins are guarded by jealous alghollthus\u2014the intelligent ichthyoid monsters who rule the deeps\u2014while dragons and formerly bound demons stalk the dry portions.",
						"One of the few cities to survive Earthfall\u2014after a fashion\u2014is Acrolan, the first of the Seven Secret Cities crafted as havens for the psychic Ascended Adepts. Though Acrolan's towers and palaces of colored glass were smashed, the secret truth is that the ruined land was only ever a monument to the real city, which lies behind it on the Ethereal Plane. Warped into hateful wraiths by the trauma of their civilization's end, the Ascended Adepts who once populated Acrolan still wait within the broken temples for those who can pass the tests to ascend to the true city and battle its masters for their vast wealth.",
						"The temple-city of Bilith-Vel is ruled by the undead monstrosity Rezallian, a lunar dragon who was horrifically warped by the death of his liege Acavna, the Azlanti goddess of the moon and battle. Acavna's death during Earthfall left Rezallian to oversee the dregs of the city's population: Azlanti degenerated into morlocks or risen as draugr, and giant, tentacled flatworms from the far side of the moon. Bilith-Vel's towers and statues to the dead goddess are sunk halfway under the waves but are still connected by soaring bridges.",
						"Yet not all of Azlant's most notable sites are haunted by survivors. Aroden's Rock was one of Azlant's tallest mountains prior to Earthfall, when it was reshaped into a mere island; there, Aroden and his followers built ships to sail east and start a new civilization. Today, the island teems with the murderous fey who opposed Aroden then, ruled by Ugurskogg, a terrifying entity from the planet's earliest days. And unmarked on any map, the fabled Towers of Heaven that were once Azlant's secret route to reaching the stars still stand dry in their salt-flat desert, guarded by a mu spore who hopes to harness their power to return home to a distant world."

						"Aroden's death in 4606 AR wracked Golarion physically and culturally, yet perhaps no evidence of his passing is so great as the massive, terrifying storm that sprang up in the Abendego Gulf. Now a stationary, seemingly permanent hurricane, the Eye of Abendego lashed Garund's western coast, drowning the nations of Lirgen and Yamasa and creating the flooded wastes known today as the Sodden Lands. While the timing of its appearance clearly ties it to the death of humanity's patron god, scholars still know little about the magic that powers it or what keeps it tethered in place. Scrying spells reveal a calm central eye clogged thick with flotsam ranging from the minuscule to entire floating structures, yet expeditions attempting to investigate in person invariably find themselves beset by air elementals, undead, and sea monsters.",
						"Still, the danger and mystery of the storm haven't prevented neighboring cultures from finding ways to make use of it. For the pirates of the Shackles, the hurricane's winds serve as a natural defense against the navies of the north. It also serves as a barrier restricting sea lanes and forcing vulnerable traders looking for sea access to the Mwangi Expanse to come right past the pirates' isles. Most Free Captains learn to use the endless storm to their advantage, darting out of its squalls to take their prey unaware before disappearing back into the storm, stymieing any pursuit. The pirate lords even host an annual race through the hurricane's edges\u2014the Free Captain's Regatt\u2014with the winner awarded an island and a seat on the Pirate Council. Similarly, the Red Mantis of Mediogalti Island use the storm's wrath as a convenient buffer against invasion by other nations. Amid the storm's wrack and beneath its waves, bloodthirsty adaros, sea devils, and krakens hunt for hapless victims and wayward treasure. And on the mainland, the boggard tribes of the Sodden Lands worship the storm as a manifestation of Rovagug."

						"A dragon-ruled civilization in the Steaming Sea, Hermea is the topic of legends and rumors among children and adults alike across the Inner Sea region. For centuries, the gold dragon Mengkare watched humanity bicker and constantly refuse to rise above their baser nature to realize their full potential. Yet while other metallic dragons largely dismissed humanity, Mengkare remained impressed by human resilience and resourcefulness, becoming convinced that\u2014with a little guidance\u2014they might one day become the civilization that would bring peace and prosperity to the planet for good. At last seeing a cause noble enough to dedicate his life to, he immediately relocated to an empty island in the southern Steaming Sea and used the wealth of his vast hoard to found Hermea, a nation dedicated to his vision of perfecting humanity.",
						"Dubbed the Glorious Endeavor, Mengkare's campaign is shrouded in mystery. Under his command, covert scouts travel the world seeking out humans who are paragons of both intelligence and physical prowess, often tracking them for years before issuing the handful of invitations Mengkare authorizes each year. Those who accept are transported to Hermea and presented with the Contract of Citizenship, in which the chosen agree to cede their free will and be bound by Mengkare's enlightened judgment forever. All former nationalities and allegiances must be renounced, including even organized religion. In exchange, recipients are promised permanent access to Hermea's extensive resources and a life of perpetual comfort while they pursue their passions in a closed society of brilliant and beautiful peers.",
						"According to residents, life in Hermea is dedicated to fulfilling one's potential, whether that be through magic or art, combat or science. While the island hosts some startlingly efficient agricultural projects, its economy is powered primarily by the sale of its crafts and expertise to outside nations. The harbor of the nation's only city, Promise, bustles with traders and scholars. All business is conducted on the docks, as few outsiders are allowed within the city's high sandstone walls. The state takes most of the funds earned in this manner, but Hermea's citizens have no worries for money\u2014each may requisition whatever they require, for a poet who dedicates himself to the perfect sonnet is just as valued by Hermean society as a wizard who crafts magical artifacts or a warrior who hires herself out to slay monsters in far-off kingdoms. Hermea's population is almost entirely human, though Mengkare sometimes brings in exceptional members of other ancestries to teach at the island's many universities, especially if they might add beneficial traits to the gene pool.",
						"Of course, while many residents of the Inner Sea region long for such a life of prestige and luxury, not everyone sees Mengkare's experiment as noble. For many, the idea of a human breeding experiment is abhorrent no matter the goal, and asking someone to sign away their personal autonomy is akin to indenturing them. Yet proponents are quick to point to the arranged marriages common in many cultures and assert that the Hermean government is simply formalizing the practice. These advocates further claim that although Mengkare wields absolute power, he honors the intelligence and independence of his subjects and takes their preferences and happiness into account. While the presence of two draconic viziers who help oversee his mission earns some rumblings of resentment, Mengkare still defers to the 13 elected officials of the Council of Enlightenment for most governmental decisions.",
						"The greatest strain in Hermean society centers around the issue of family: while Hermea-born children are given every advantage, those who don't show sufficient potential for Mengkare's standards of greatness when they undergo the Assessment at age 16 are banished to the mainland, never to return. Known grounds for banishment include merely average intelligence, lack of life goals, mental illness of any kind, physical impairments, and disruptive behavior; in other instances, the reason is a mystery to both the unfortunate exiles and their families."

Yet beneath the surface chaos, the island is in fact a tightly controlled nation run by one of the most feared organizations on Golarion: the Red Mantis assassins.",
						"Following a vision from their murderous god Achaekek, the Red Mantis fled the Oath Wars in Rahadoum and settled the island in 2559 AR. They quickly began construction on a new headquarters, the Crimson Citadel, deep in the verdant mountains of the island's interior. After it was finally completed nearly 4 decades later, the cult turned its attention to converting the existing pirate town of Ilizmagorti on the island's northern shore into a haven for criminals and fugitives, the better to host those looking to contact the assassins with job offers. Though the Red Mantis has little interest in directly governing the affairs of locals, it officially owns all establishments on the island, with proprietors paying for the privilege of operating them. The city's constantly shifting population of thieves and scoundrels remains astonishingly polite due to the well-known fact that most members of the Red Mantis live covertly among the city's residents, so any bartender or shopkeeper could be a highly skilled assassin in disguise.",
						"The Red Mantis itself is a mysterious organization, though its agents, when active, are instantly recognizable by their black-and-red armor, mantis-like helmets, and sawtooth sabers. The assassins' fame comes not just from their incredible reliability, but from the fact that they ensure their clients stay dead, preventing any chance of resurrection. Their fees vary widely, and while nonnegotiable, are largely symbolic\u2014for the Red Mantis, assassination is a form of worship. All targets are valid apart from rightfully placed rulers of nations; these are exempted by divine law. Rank-and-file agents are self-organized into cells to fulfill various contracts, but all pay deference to the Blood Mistress, who acts as the undisputed voice of Achaekek, and to her Vernai (or \"High Killers\"), a cabal of mostly female assassin lords.",
						"Only Red Mantis members know the exact location of the Crimson Citadel\u2014would-be clients who seek the cult's attention instead typically advertise their desires in Ilizmagorti. Yet rumors of the stronghold's wonders and horrors are still whispered in bars and throne rooms across Golarion. The lower levels, called the Ruby Halls to evoke walls stained with blood, are the cult's training center, stocked with deadly beasts and traps. The central levels, called the Honeyed Gardens, make up a pleasure palace where the assassins celebrate successful jobs with every vice imaginable, relaxing in the spray of a waterfall of fresh blood. The fortress's towers, called the Lavish Heart, house the cult's leadership, while a hidden sanctum called the Iron Heart holds the Sarzari Library, said to be an impressive collection of ancient knowledge accessible only by the Blood Mistress herself."

						"Since time beyond memory, Golarion's elves have been at war with the scheming alghollthus. Thus, when the Azlanti first rose to power as servants of the alghollthus' so-called veiled masters, the elves considered the Azlanti enemies as well, and built a magical observatory off their shores to spy on them. These observers were among the first to learn of the alghollthus' plan to bring about Earthfall, and they warned elvenkind to retreat to Sovyrian. When elves returned from Sovyrian millennia later, they found that their former outpost had been crushed by the falling body of Acavna, the Azlanti goddess of the moon and battle, who died trying to defend her people. In its place, a strange tower had grown\u2014one that whispered to them with a goddess's voice.",
						"In that voice and in the disturbing visions it granted, they found a calling. Now considering themselves the heirs of Azlant, the former observers settled in the tower and cut themselves off from the rest of the world, laying claim to the shattered continent. They guard it both to protect this claim and as defense against humanity ever rediscovering the power\u2014and hubris\u2014of the lost nation and somehow triggering a second Earthfall.",
						"After generations of isolation, the elves of the Mordant Spire are few in number and have become secretive and xenophobic, strange even to their former brethren. Often refusing to speak anything but Azlanti, they wear elaborate wooden masks whenever dealing with outsiders, and they often change the subject or stop speaking mid-sentence, cocking their heads as if listening to an inaudible voice. Completely self-sufficient, they live on rocky beaches and floating platforms anchored to the sea floor, tending kelp beds and fish farms. Outsiders are likely to interact with the elves only if they break the Mordant Spire's rules against exploring Azlant's ruins, in which case they find themselves quickly beset by elven warriors who patrol the region in rune-carved vessels that skim the waves faster than any ordinary ship. Captured trespassers have any Azlanti treasures confiscated and their minds wiped with magic.",
						"The Mordant Spire elves are highly regimented. The Amaranthine Council rules unconditionally and never leaves the tower; its members are marked by the purple vapor that leaks from their empty eye sockets. Beneath them, the Listeners keep to the Vigilant Halls near the tower's peak, communing with the spirit of the tower and observing Azlant's ruins through magical seawater lenses. When they detect a threat, they dispatch the Mordant Censors, the warriors and spellcasters who make up the bulk of the patrols. Many other specialized roles also exist, including the rare diplomats who warn other nations to stay away and the saboteurs who ensure any serious incursion never gets off the ground. Still, in recent years, some of the elves have begun to grudgingly work with colonists in Azlant to face larger alghollthu threats, and it may be only a matter of time until the Spire's strict traditions change."

In addition to its usual raiding, the new fleet sold its services to Sargava, promising to secure the colony's independence from Cheliax in exchange for tribute. Though the overthrow of Sargava's colonial government eventually ended the agreement, it lasted long enough for the pirate government to fully establish itself, and the buccaneer federation has to date managed to weather several invasions by fleets from Cheliax and Rahadoum. Today, under the rule of Hurricane Queen Tessa Fairwind, the pirates of the Shackles are bolder than ever before, raiding all along the western coasts of Avistan and Garund.",
						"The Shackles themselves are as chaotic as one might expect, with each port having its own laws and customs enforced absolutely by its pirate lord. By far the largest is Port Peril, situated on the mainland and guarded by the cannons of Fort Hazard on the cliffs overlooking Jeopardy Bay. In its narrow streets, fugitives cut deals with addicts and unscrupulous merchants, happily ignored by the pirates who run the town. Adventurers sometimes stop in the port before heading into the Terwa Uplands in search of legendary sites like the Temple of the Ravenous Moon\u2014or down into the sea caves beneath the city, where fortunes in pirate gold are said to be stashed away.",
						"Yet the nation's de facto capital is only one port of many. For most outsiders, the port of Quent is the most welcoming, with the Calistrian-run House of Stolen Kisses brokering companionship and information. Hell Harbor's imp-filled sky and Chelish affectations offer a taste of the north, run by disgraced Chelish ex-admiral Arronax Endymion. For those who enjoy living on the edge, Widowmaker Island offers all manner of gambling and blood sports\u2014including mock naval battles in a monster-infested lake. Less welcoming to outsiders are captains like the Master of Gales, the druid who rules the driftwood shanties of Drenchport, or Avimar Sorrinash, whose werewolf crew hunts his own port city of Ollo when the moon is full.",
						"Brigands of all kinds can make a home in the Shackles, but half-elves, half-orcs, and humans of all ethnicities are most common, along with the bird-headed tengus whom local sailors consider a sign of good luck. Outside the few settled ports, however, inhabitants quickly grow more monstrous, with sea devils and locathahs claiming the waters, lizardfolk Terwa Lords raiding from the north, and water nagas hunting the mainland along the Slithering Coast. Yet despite the danger, scoundrels and fortune-seekers of all nations continue to flock to the Shackles, seeking opportunity, hideouts, or possibly relics of the powerful sorceries that brought down the cyclopes' empire."

						"The waterways of the Inner Sea region are more heavily populated below than they are above. Entire cultures lurk beneath the waves, often unknown to their coastal neighbors until they emerge from the water to trade\u2014or to drag prisoners back to the briny deep. Merfolk are quick to punish those who trespass across their invisible borders, while sadistic goblinoid grindylows and clever sea hags love to wreak havoc on coastal settlements. Other aquatic cultures are more cooperative; for example, it's not uncommon for curious locathahs\u2014fish-like humanoids\u2014to trade with ships or act as guides through dangerous waters. Tentacled cecaelias often act as nomadic mercenaries or traders, traveling from port to port leading pack rays loaded with salvage from the depths. And there's plenty of such salvage to be found\u2014thanks to the devastation of Earthfall, the floor of the Inner Sea is littered with the drowned ruins of elven and serpentfolk cities as well as countless shipwrecks. South toward Jalmeray, the waters quickly grow more dangerous, with creatures like the eel-like iku-tursos capturing whole ship crews for the undersea slave trade.",

In the north, the Steaming Sea\u2014so named for the fog that rises off its frigid waters\u2014makes for a perilous home. While coastal Varisians and the Ulfen of the Ironbound Archipelago rely on the sea for survival, all know that its freezing waves can kill as quickly as the krakens, skum, and ravenous sea devils that plague ships venturing too far from their sheltering islands. In the south, the Fever Sea is warmer, but just as dangerous. For every friendly undersea group, like kraken-hunting squadrons of tritons, there are creatures like the storm-worshipping adaros who sacrifice prisoners to the Eye of Abendego. Still, the tropical waters are often worth risking, and magical salvage divers operating out of Vidrian and the Kaava Lands do a brisk business in artifacts and treasure pulled from sunken fleets or from the swampy apocalypse of the Sodden Lands.",

So it is in Gholinom, deep in an ocean trench west of Rahadoum. As much a factory as a city, its mountainous, twisting towers have stood atop volcanic vents for millennia, gathering magical and geothermic power that crackles in magenta rings around them as black smoke billows from their tips. Conduits of stone and skymetal weave through the palaces and laboratories of the many-eyed masterminds and their terrified slave-scholars, all leading to a vast circular gate at the city's heart. Dubbed the Passage Outward, this gateway consists of four concentric rings, each rotating in an opposing direction from those around it and made of a different skymetal\u2014abysium, djezet, orichalcum, and inubrix. This gateway has never opened, yet those slaves most trusted (or burdened) with knowledge of the gate suggest that it's intended to open onto a realm beyond space and time that their masters refer to as the Final Sea. The entire project was secret until just recently, when Professor Karnvale Havillip, a halfling venture-captain thought lost in a shipwreck years ago, returned to the Grand Lodge in Absalom bearing a harrowing tale of escape and a warning that, after ages of preparation, the Passage Outward may be about to open."

						"The independent kingdoms of Garund's so-called Impossible Lands trace their histories back millennia. Even today the region's sparkling cities, breathtaking monuments, and arcane accomplishments seem rooted in some distant epoch when miracles were commonplace and legendary monsters walked alongside heroes bound for grand destinies. In prehistoric times, the region fell under the domain of a vast cyclops empire, whose megalithic ruins and broad, half-buried causeways hint at a grandeur seldom matched in the present day. Long after Earthfall toppled these monuments and reduced their builders into scattered, survivalist masses, armies of the god-kings of Osirion established cities and colonies amid the ruins. Pharaonic legions brought an end to older human empires like the Jistka Imperium and the Tekritanin League along Garund's northwestern coast. They also conquered many of the scattered indigenous peoples of the continent's east coast, whether through pacification or subjugation, greatly extending the borders of their kingdom. Over millennia, the power of Osirion faded, and the weakened pharaohs cut off all contact with their distant colonies, leaving these nations to develop as independent kingdoms.",
						"The history of the Impossible Lands has been dominated by two of the region's most powerful nations\u2014both of which take their names from their respective immortal wizard-king founders, Geb and Nex. The two kingdoms clashed thousands of years ago in a devastating, centuries-long arcane war that warped the fabric of the continent itself. The most obvious scar of this conflict is the twisted wasteland that lies between them, a gnarled landscape of magic-warped terrain ravaged by arcane storms known as the Mana Wastes. From nightmare beasts born of the Fleshforges of Nex to the countless undead making up the populace of Geb, the region remains stained with the hubris of these two mages, and the thought of their lands once having been free from Nex and Geb's tyranny seems more fable than fact to the people caught in their wake.",
						"Despite this tumultuous history, the realms of Nex, Geb, and Jalmeray, along with the city-state of Alkenstar, count themselves among the mightiest and most fantastical nations in all the lands of the Inner Sea. Nex, who remains one of the most powerful and influential archmages Golarion has ever known, set the archetype for the Impossible Lands. Over the millennia of his immortal existence, he has taken control of the city-states of Quantium, Ecanus, and Oenopion, lavishing arcane innovations and architectural marvels upon them. Nex's hated enemy, the equally ancient ghost necromancer Geb, rules a cosmopolitan, prosperous nation that would be considered among Garund's wealthiest and most promising kingdoms, if not for the fact that most of its inhabitants are undead monstrosities who willingly followed their baleful leader into eternity to serve his dark designs forever. Off the coast, the lush isle of Jalmeray is a portal to western Casmaron, offering a slice of culture from distant Vudra on the doorstep of the Inner Sea. Monks from all over the world flock to the isle to hone their bodies and minds, following esoteric traditions handed down in antiquity by otherworldly spirits. Like Nex and Geb before them, these stalwarts intend through great effort and even greater creations to transcend the limits of the ordinary world\u2014a task suited for nowhere else but the Impossible Lands."

						"The arcane wars between Nex and Geb were not kind to the surrounding regions, often reducing their captured territories to blasted wastelands where warped radiation prevented all magic from functioning. The nation of Alkenstar arose in such a place, beneath the shadow of Dongun Hold\u2014a dwarven Sky Citadel sealed by its former occupants to prevent it from becoming a prize handed back and forth between the two warring powers. Though the dwarves had abandoned their fortress more than a thousand years earlier, the surrounding ruins became a haven for a ragtag settlement of refugees and vagabonds. When a renegade engineer named Alkenstar fled from Nex to avoid criminal charges, he discovered the shattered ruins of Dongun Hold and used his technology to fortify the settlement, bring agriculture to its nearby plains, and transform the powerful Ustradi River into a literal engine of creation.",
						"Not content to simply live in the shadow of the mighty Dongun Hold, Alkenstar devised an ingenious method to open the dwarven Sky Citadel and explore its many mysteries. He and his followers eventually tracked down the missing dwarves themselves, who now resided in an isolated vault deep in the Darklands where the practice of magic had died. A bargain between Alkenstar and the dwarves provided the fledgling city with a dwarven innovation perfected during the dwarves' time in the vault and destined to change the course of history: firearms. These weapons ensured that the refugees would never again be caught defenseless in the battles between Nex and Geb. And over the last century, the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar has grown into a powerful, if isolated, kingdom in its own right.",
						"While Nex still claims the settlement as a nominal vassal, since its armies were the last to claim Dongun Hold in the Age of Destiny before the dwarves' retreat, no one takes this claim seriously outside the governmental halls of Quantium. Alkenstar currently operates as an independent city-state with holdings that include Dongun Hold and the town of Martel. The city of Alkenstar itself stands atop the Hellfallen Cliffs, overlooking a narrow valley where the Ustradi River plunges hundreds of feet over the massive Alken Falls on its journey into Nex. A layer of soot covers most of Alkenstar's brick-and-iron buildings, but elegant brass decorations shining through the grime hint at the grand architecture beneath. Voluminous clouds of steam hang over the city and sometimes cover its streets, mixing with the thick fog banks drifting off the Ustradi and the acrid black smoke churning from the city's omnipresent factories. At the southeastern shore of Lake Ustradi sits a massive castle called the Gunworks, where metallurgists and engineers of Alkenstar labor to develop firearms technology. Their proudest achievement is a massive cannon known as the Great Maw of Rovagug\u2014an enormous bombard with a range measured in miles that is often used against the mutated giants of the Mana Wastes who raid the city nearly every summer.",
						"The inventiveness that raised Alkenstar into a nation now permeates the attitudes of the country's residents, and its technological innovations keep it economically and politically relevant despite its seemingly precarious position. The city's famous clockwork sentries are only the most visible of Alkenstar's wonders. Guilds of enterprising metallurgists, alchemists, and engineers collaborate or compete to produce increasingly extraordinary discoveries. Alkenstar's status as a haven from the prying eyes of Nex and Geb has also attracted refugees and immigrants in a flow that rivals the mighty Ustradi, swelling the city's population and spreading knowledge and political philosophies in their wake.",
						"Yet this rampant growth carries a price in exchange for Alkenstar's nigh-miraculous ascension into a global power. Though the nation's High Parliament and elite police do an admirable job enforcing law and order, Alkenstar remains a frontier boom town in a harsh and hostile land. The city's government and industries are convoluted and disordered, riddled with flaws and redundancies that have cropped up as organizational need outstrips bureaucratic capacity. Corruption and rivalries abound between clans, guilds, and families, with factions struggling to increase their own influence within the nation. Common folk rarely see the benefits of the city's industry, left behind by the rapid march of progress to eke out hard, short lives within the heavy smog from the workshops. Crime plagues the nation's outcasts, orphans, and poor, especially preying on the financial insecurity of desperate refugees from other nations.",
						"Firearm and siege engine production has vastly increased over the last decade, thanks in no small part to the leadership of Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia, who is both a canny politician and a scientist in her own right. Guns, already popular among smugglers and revolutionaries in the Mwangi Expanse and the Shackles, have begun to trickle into northern Garund as well. Ricia urges greater contact with the outside world by exporting Alkenstar's fabulous creations far and wide, drawing even more customers, vagabonds, and would-be technologists to the city-state, despite the considerable dangers of the journey."

						"Three hundred years after the fall of Osirion's famed Four Pharaohs of Ascension, the pious tyrant Kenaton brought a semblance of stability to the declining empire, scouring Osirion of enemies and renewing the empire's grasp on distant territorial holdings. Rather than vanish across the horizon into eternal exile, the wicked necromancer Geb came to Osirion's southernmost colony, conquered it, and granted it his name, remaking it in his own necrotic image. Decades after his rise to power, Geb came into conflict with the archmage Nex, who had united a nation on the plains north of the necromancer's kingdom, cutting off land access to the markets of the Golden Road. By \u2013892 AR, the territorial ambitions of both Nex and Geb erupted into catastrophic open conflict that would span centuries.",
						"The war reached its terrible climax when Geb blighted the lands of Nex, starving its people and bringing it to the brink of utter defeat. Nex responded by unleashing a series of magical cataclysms that killed uncountable thousands of Geb's citizens. Anguished at the scope of the devastation, Geb animated all of the slain as a vast undead army, which he immediately sent marching north. In 576 AR\u2014after nearly a millennium of mutually destructive warfare\u2014Geb's undead armies made a final grand push toward Quantium, reaching the walls of Nex's palace, the Bandeshar. Poisonous yellow smoke choked the archmage's capital, killing thousands\u2014but Nex himself apparently escaped into a demiplane known as the Refuge of Nex, never to return. Despite his apparent victory, Geb remained convinced that his old foe had somehow survived, and he lived the next several decades in bitter resentment, futilely waiting for Nex's imminent return. Nex's household servants, the so-called Arclords of Nex, also proved frustratingly resilient, repelling numerous attacks on the Bandeshar designed to seal Nex away for eternity. Finally, in 632, Geb's torment grew too strong to bear, and he ended his mortal life in an act of ritual suicide. But even in death, Geb's hatred tethered his soul to Golarion as a ghost.",
						"Thereafter, Gebbite society gave itself wholly to necromancy. Thousands of Geb's most fanatical followers killed themselves to bind their undead souls in service to their ghostly sovereign, swearing eternal fealty in the ultimate act of obedience. Today, more than 4,000 years later, the undead make up Gebbite society, and most mortals in the kingdom are either slaves or food. A complex corpus of legal documents known as the \"Dead Laws\" protect the rights of Geb's mortals and intelligent undead by regulating the feeding of ravenous undead, proscribing certain aspects of necromancy, outlawing the channeling of positive energy, and dictating the proper treatment and maintenance of slaves, both living and undead. These rules nominally protect the living\u2014referred to as the \"Quick\" in the language of the Dead Laws\u2014from random attacks by the hungry dead. But Geb's ghoulish low nobility, along with certain insatiable vampires, consider themselves exempt, often risking legal prosecution and permanent death to satiate their gluttonous cravings.",
						"By royal decree, unless specified otherwise, all mortals who die upon Geb's soil are reanimated as mindless undead to serve as slaves in the nation's lush fields or lavish urban mansions. Mortals with business in Geb often arrange to become intelligent undead upon death to avoid this fate. Most mortals avoid going to Geb whatsoever. Mortal necromancers are an exception, largely because they are the only ones who know how to protect themselves from the depravities of Geb's nobility. The most puissant and ambitious necromancers of Geb join the ranks of the Blood Lords, 60 personal apprentices that Geb himself trained in the capital of Mechitar and tasked with administering the daily affairs of the kingdom. Once exclusively mortal, the Blood Lords are now overwhelmingly undead, and their numbers include vampires, wraiths, mummies, shades, and liches.",
						"Geb doesn't invite conflict with other nations, despite the brazen attacks so often made against it by would-be heroes hoping to destroy the undead kingdom. Tensions with Nex cooled once its leader fled Golarion, and zombie-harvested crops sent north are among the nation's most prosperous exports. Geb's undead ruling class doesn't age, so they can afford to play the long game and be patient, weaving political plots that span centuries, and which delve far more deeply into the international politics of the Inner Sea region than anyone realizes.",
						"In recent centuries, Geb had largely withdrawn from the daily affairs of his kingdom, leaving its management in the capable hands of his imprisoned lich-queen, Arazni. A former herald of Aroden cruelly raised from death by Geb in retribution for repeated attacks by the paladins of Lastwall, Arazni ruled the nation for centuries before escaping Geb and his kingdom in recent years. With Arazni gone and the king more certain than ever of Nex's imminent return, Geb has returned to active rulership of his kingdom. The morbid avenues of Mechitar throng with skeletal celebrants in public processions honoring Geb's renaissance, and the ghost-sovereign's agents in the outside world are known to be gathering rare ingredients for what appears to be a series of obscene necromantic rituals carried out on a massive ceremonial scale. Far from the melancholic recluse who sought a solution in suicide, Geb today prepares himself and his undying kingdom for a grand destiny."

						"The island nation of Jalmeray was once the domain of legendary Vudrani Maharajah Khiben-Sald. Once a favored guest of the archmage Nex, the maharajah rapidly outstayed his welcome in Nex's court, and the archmage began to view his newfound friend as a distraction and potential rival. To resolve the situation without conflict, Nex granted Khiben-Sald the whole of the isle of Jalmeray as his personal domain. Eventually, Khiben-Sald returned to his homeland, leaving behind only glorious monuments and conjured genies. The island nation changed hands twice afterward. The Arclords of Nex, who had been exiled from their nation in the power struggle following Nex's disappearance, took refuge on Jalmeray despite resistance from Khiben-Sald's remaining genies. Yet in 2822 AR, hundreds of Vudrani rajahs arrived in a vast fleet and claimed Jalmeray as their personal domain, presenting documents affirming their blood relation to Khiben-Sald and thus their rightful ownership of the island. When the Arclords refused to leave, the Vudrani summoned an army of genies that sank all but one of the Arclords' ships. Following this, the Vudrani unsealed their ancient monuments and stirred their otherworldly guardians to life once more.",
						"Today, Jalmeray is the window to the east, a bastion of Vudrani culture on the edge of the Inner Sea region. Breathtaking marvels of architecture are combined with powerful magic to create the nation's beautiful and luxurious settlements, such as Jalmeray's capital, the many-tiered pagoda city of Niswan. Foreigners drawn to Jalmeray's unique sights are met by a friendly and hospitable culture, making the island a popular destination for those who can afford and manage the journey. Ancient noble families, powerful mystics, and the esteemed masters of monasteries oversee the needs of citizens and visitors alike, playing lip service to the nation's monarch but in truth handling most day to day affairs themselves.",
						"While most of its population shares ancestral roots in Vudra, the streets of Jalmeray are walked by all manner of people and creatures, many of them visitors from distant lands. Genies and elemental beings remain from the island's ancient days, tasked with guarding cities and cultivating the natural beauty of the nation into a splendor known across the world. Generations of humans and genies living side by side have given rise to a large population of people known as geniekin, who carry a spark of elemental heritage within them. Garudas and nagas send emissaries to Jalmeray's monarch, while rakshasas and asuras hide among the cities to tempt the pious into ruin.",
						"Yet for all of Jalmeray's wonders, the nation's darker aspects burden the populace. In a land where the wondrous is commonplace, citizens often fall afoul of equally wondrous curses\u2014those who cannot rid themselves of these fell magics often have nowhere else to turn but a shunned, quarantined island to the north of Jalmeray's shores. Crueler still is the fate of those born with signs of taint from wicked asuras or rakshasas, as they are forced to work backbreaking and unsavory jobs such as cleaning sewage.",
						"Trade has made Jalmeray unthinkably wealthy, but the nation is best known for its learning and philosophy. Academics melds with religion, with temples serving as bastions of learning and libraries boasting richly-illustrated copies of holy texts. Thousands of shrines dedicated to thousands of gods offer written guidance on the many paths to attain enlightenment. Prestigious schools for every way and walk of life can be found within Jalmeray's cities, from magic to poetry to political intrigue and seduction. Jalmeray's famous monasteries, collectively known as the Houses of Perfection, export doctrines of physical, mental, and spiritual development across Avistan, Casmaron, and Garund.",
						"These Houses are also the center of Jalmeray's proud tradition of exemplary martial arts. Students from throughout the Inner Sea venture to Jalmeray to test themselves against the challenges offered by the Houses. Those who wish to prove their worthiness must succeed at a series of seemingly impossible trials against emissaries of the elements themselves: racing against the wind-swift speed of a djinni, wrestling the mountainous power of a shaitan, outwitting the flame-sharp wit of an efreeti, or performing other, similarly fantastical, tasks. Those elite few who complete these tasks are trained to push their bodies to the peak of physical and mental perfection, achieving spiritual balance and opening their minds to transcend the normal limits of mortal potential. Once every decade, the Houses of Perfection meet in friendly competition in a grand tournament called the Challenge of Sky and Heaven. Students compete in the schools of historical knowledge, swordplay, unarmed fighting techniques, mastery of the self, arcane ability, and other esoteric disciplines. Thakur Kharswan and his vast legion of advisors known as the Maurya-Rahm sponsor additional contests, like the Solemn Sky Duel of Masters, which draws combatants not just from across the Inner Sea region but from all parts of the world."

						"The warped wasteland between Nex and Geb bears the indelible scars of 14 centuries of arcane conflict. In ancient days, the region was renowned for its natural beauty, which inspired breathtaking artworks from the dwarves of Dongun Hold. The dwarves ruled the land surrounding their Sky Citadel for centuries without harassment by the god-kings of Osirion or the petty tyrants who ruled in their ruined colonies, but when the archmage Nex waged war with the necromancer Geb, Dongun Hold found itself wedged between two implacable enemies. Minor skirmishes blossomed into clashes between vast armies, legions of constructs, potent summoned monsters, and ravenous undead. After centuries of shifting annexation by Geb or Nex, the dwarves of Dongun Hold withdrew into their Sky Citadel and collapsed the entrance to their imposing fortress, leaving their lands to be blasted into barren, arcane ruins.",
						"From vast alchemical miasmas to chaotic eldritch storms to the unquiet souls of annihilated armies, the Mana Wastes swirl with unpredictable dangers seen nowhere else on Golarion. Rife with carnivorous plants, shattered-glass sandstorms, and poisonous fogs, the landscape itself seems singularly dedicated to destroying those who attempt to traverse or settle its tenacious wilderness. To the west, in a sprawling region of dead magic, the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar provides the Mana Wastes' most secure sanctum, drawing not just traditional refugees, escaped slaves, and wanderers, but increasingly merchants, foreign diplomats, and dwarves seeking to reunite with their returned cousins at Dongun Hold. Those journeying to and from Alkenstar must endure not just the terrors of the Mana Wastes' unnatural environment, but also the predations of the magic-warped monstrosities who call the place home\u2014rifle-toting mutants, spectral soldiers, murderously erratic constructs, and worse.",
						"Further west, the Mana Wastes sweep upward from Alkenstar into the hills and mountains of the Western Ravage. Here, cloaked by the same energies that keep magic out of Alkenstar, dwell several tribes of mutated giants, ettins, and ogres, brutal creatures who make near-annual summer raids on the city-state and engage in violent struggles with one another when not focused on a mutual enemy. After decades of suffering at the hands of those wielding Alkenstar's firearms, the giants of the Western Ravage now find it necessary to finally crack open Dongun Hold and plunder its wealth. Their raids on the Gunworks have already yielded dozens of longarms, scores of pistols, and several cannons\u2014which the largest giants can wield like rifles.",
						"In the east, the lowlands sprawl into a gnarled wasteland of jagged tors and rocky dunes called the Spellscar Desert. Virtually devoid of water and baked with blistering heat by day, the inhospitable terrain abounds with shattered, otherworldly ruins predating the devastation of the wizard-kings' war. The mutated inhabitants of these forlorn ruins, their bodies wracked by the same arcane abominations that warped and twisted the landscape, mercilessly prey upon travelers foolhardy enough to cross the desert.",
						"The dearth of magic allows some semblance of normality within Alkenstar's territory in the Western Ravage, but the Spellscar Desert is constantly devastated by churning currents of raw magic, supernatural storms, tears in the veil of reality, and other disastrous aftereffects of the nearly endless arcane cataclysms of wizard-king warfare. These unusual effects warp both the land and its inhabitants, and occasionally bleed north up the Ustradi River or are blown across the plains of Geb and Nex upon uncharitable winds. Often these storms have no physical manifestation, but just as often they're accompanied by the march of pestilential ghost armies, cacophonous gibbering that echoes for hours, slicing rains of tiny metal shards, or other horrifying phenomena."

						"The archmage Nex, an avid arcanist determined to make his mark in a world newly filled with opportunity, arose in the centuries following Osirion's withdrawal from its imperial holdings in eastern Garund. Fueled by the kind of ambition that gave the Age of Destiny its name, Nex perfected his arcane craft to gain dominion over the powerful city-state of Quantium, located at the mouth of the mighty Ustradi River. From this seat of power, Nex swiftly subjugated the neighboring cities of Ecanus and Oenopion, gathering his conquered realms into a new kingdom bearing his name.",
						"Over the following centuries, Nex traveled the world and the Great Beyond, establishing important theories of magic that remain foundational to this day. He funneled the treasures claimed during his adventures back into his kingdom, training hundreds of eager wizards in the secrets of the arcane discoveries he plundered from other worlds. He used {@i wish}-level magics to improve his kingdom and protect it from harm. Confident in his successes, he continued to march his construct armies further south to the lush farmlands of an abandoned Osiriani farming colony\u2014now the domain of the necromancer-lord Geb.",
						"The resulting relentless warfare between Nex and Geb spanned centuries, with each wizard extending his life and attempting to destroy the other through a series of increasingly catastrophic magical attacks. In one such escalation, Geb and his grim devotees conducted rituals that corrupted the rural lands of Nex, denuding its forests in an instant and forever blighting its plains. The wizards of Nex erected magical barriers to protect the cities, but the landscape beyond the city walls was reduced to wasteland. The ancient curses persist to this day, one of the worst of the many scars inflicted upon the world in the wizards' millennium-long conflict.",
						"Ironically, destruction of the vast majority of his kingdom left Nex with more time to study and perfect his craft. He finally achieved true immortality when he created a personal demiplane at a flux point of multiversal energy, a domain of near-limitless power he called the Crux of Nex. Nex carved off a shard of the Crux to create the mile-tall Spire of Nex outside of Absalom, as well as the so-called Refuge of Nex, a supernatural haven he constructed in the basement dungeons of his personal palace, the Bandeshar. The Crux joined the Refuge and Spire into a vast, yet connected, multidimensional complex, and in 576 AR\u2014with a Gebbite army at Quantium's gates and vaporous banks of poison gas seeping through its streets\u2014Nex retreated into the Refuge, never to be seen again.",
						"In the centuries since, the rule of the nation has fallen to a succession of factions that purport to represent the departed archmage's plan for the subjects and projects he left behind. The contentious Council of Three and Nine attempts to maintain consensus between Nex's squabbling sects and has managed to keep Nex unconquered since the day its founder vanished.",
						"Open warfare with Geb decreased in the centuries following Nex's departure, and today the two nations maintain an uneasy standstill in their hostilities. The Arclords of Nex\u2014descendants of the wizard's apprentices and household servants who purport to possess his personal writings and thus best understand his desires\u2014claim that Nex would be appalled at the state of peace with his hated undead foe, pointing to the recent re-opening of the magical gates to the Refuge of Nex as a sure sign that the old conflict is about to reignite.",
						"Nex's capital, Quantium, is a cosmopolitan metropolis with nearly 80,000 souls (not all of them mortal), monumental palaces, cloud-piercing spires, and teeming streets filled with all manner of humans joined by creatures that would be considered monsters elsewhere on Golarion. The Council of Three and Nine rules from the Bandeshar, and nervousness about what many interpret to be the imminent return of Nex himself is causing significant political rifts in the council that seem on the verge of metastasizing into a war of subterfuge. Across the barren, outlaw-ravaged wasteland, the alchemists of Oenopion toil to create the eldritch elixirs and potions so important to the nation's economy. The squalid city claims an impressive golemworks and an ooze colony that dominates a vast miasmatic lake at the center of town, a sentient hivemind useful for potent divinations and the disposal of faulty magical items, botched golems, and enemies of the state. The sprawling, heavily fortified town of Ecanus is the hub of Nex's vast military. Battlemages trained in warfare and tactical evocation form the backbone of the mobile force, reinforced by nightmarish beasts churned out by the city's monumental fleshforges."

Stories of the magic warriors' exploits abound, such as how they defeated the King of Biting Ants to liberate the Doorway to the Red Star, or aided Jatembe in creating the Ring of Nine Facets.

						"No one alive today can say for sure who built Kibwe's towering granite walls, though all agree that they predate Holy Xatramba, the lost nation that controlled the city centuries ago before falling to demons. Rising thick and impregnable from the surrounding jungle, Kibwe's walls slope inward, their faces covered with thousands of ancient and often indecipherable runes. Inside, the city is a tangle of neighborhoods organized by nationality, ethnic group, or belief system, with first-time visitors sometimes complaining that the predominant language changes every time one crosses the road. Fortunately, the same ancients who built Kibwe's walls also provided a valuable navigational aid: the Pillar-Watchers, soapstone statues and idols perched atop high columns. Often taking bizarre shapes\u2014tusked tiger-people or featherless humanoid birds, always armed with swords and shields\u2014the idols are said to stand guard over the city, ready to come alive in the residents' time of greatest need. While locals differ on how much they believe the stories, all can agree that the Pillars act as valuable landmarks in a city where street signs can change languages a dozen times in an as many steps.",
						"Kibwe maintains a strict neutrality in political affairs in the interest of greater trade. The city-state is governed by a council of representatives appointed by various clans and micro-communities. Public debates are common in the Adayenki Pavilion, a sacred and petal-strewn common space walled off from the bustle of the market by hanging tapestries and animal hides. Though this representative approach to democracy has historically resulted in a raucous but stable government, of late the council has been hard-pressed by forces both within and without. Since the council's recent decision to outlaw slavery, the neighborhood of Bekyar Block has roiled on the edge of violence as former slavers plot to reverse the ruling. At the same time, international traders like the Aspis Consortium constantly seek to promote unrest in order to assume control of the city's considerable mining claims, and the once-small Bwamandu Camp\u2014the neighborhood devoted to taking in refugees from Usaro\u2014has swollen with immigrants and threatens to overwhelm the city's resources. With so much pressure, it seems like only a matter of time until something breaks, and it's anyone's guess whether Kibwe's patchwork society will band together as one or come apart at the seams."

						"The temple-city of Mzali was once the center of an ancient empire ruled by semi-divine sun-kings. Long ago, a powerful group of shamans called the Council of Mwanyisa successfully toppled the monarchy\u2014yet the shamans were unable to hold the state together. Under their rule, the empire crumbled, until by the Age of Lost Omens they barely controlled even the half-empty capital city.",
						"Given time, Mzali might eventually have been abandoned. Yet a century ago, members of the council received a vision prophesying the empire's rebirth. Soon after, while delving into one of the city's many hidden tombs, they discovered a child-mummy dressed in the garments of a sun-king. Ancient texts proclaimed the mummy Walkena, a legendary child-god who commanded magic beyond anything the shamans could imagine. The council promptly put this relic of their ancient power on public display, yet the resulting flood of local pilgrims to the city\u2014and stories of fabulous treasures discovered alongside the mummy\u2014drew the attention of Chelish colonists in Kalabuto. The colonists attacked Mzali only to be utterly immolated as the mummy miraculously sprang to life and called down fire from the sky.",
						"Since his triumphant return, Walkena has ruled Mzali absolutely, with the Council of Mwanyisa reduced to an advisory role. Beneath his undead gaze, the city buzzes once more with the life. Thousands of Mwangi have flocked to serve Walkena, bolstered by the child-god's public mission to drive out northern colonizers and unite the Expanse under his own flag. Yet this rebirth of home rule is a double-edged sword, for Walkena's policies are far from progressive. Cruel and powerful, the mummy shows blatant favoritism to his supporters and sentences any who question him to the horrific and fatal Punishment of Seven Angry Suns. Trade with non-Mwangi is banned, and anyone found associating with outsiders without explicit permission is labeled a traitor. These pressures\u2014combined with the fact that the new state of Vidrian recently managed to overthrow its colonialist regime without Walkena's help\u2014have recently drawn many Mzali citizens away from the city, enraging their ruler and resulting in rumors that the child-god may be planning an attack against Vidrian. This tension has only intensified in the presence of the Bright Lions, a group of Mzali insurgents who seek to overthrow Walkena and return their city to the people.",
						"Located on the banks of the Pasuango River, deep in the Mwangi's remote southern plains, Mzali is a sprawling mass of cathedrals and monuments that become reflected in the water that covers the streets every monsoon season. Knotted trees wrap massive roots around thick curtain walls and stone temple complexes, their shapes often integrated into the architecture, with most major structures surrounded by moats for protection and drainage. In the center of the city, Walkena's Temple of the Deathless Child towers above nearby buildings, yet the city is awash in ancient shrines to entities both contemporary and forgotten, some in active use and others co-opted to house markets or tenements. As much a necropolis as a holy city, Mzali also holds dozens of burial mounds: pyramidal tombs dug deep into the earth with only the capstones visible, the rest of the monuments hidden beneath the foundations of other structures. Walkena himself was discovered in one such burial mound, and despite the danger, opportunistic grave robbers still occasionally sneak past the city's checkpoints in hopes of harvesting valuable relics from these unplumbed crypts."

						"Sometimes called the Song-Wind City for the cheerful chimes of colored glass that hang from its every building, Nantambu is a bastion of peace and sophistication. Canals from the Vanji River carry water not just to the city but through it, demarcating districts in great curving lines topped by graceful, arching bridges. In Nantambu's cosmopolitan markets, spices and magic from across the Expanse flow freely\u2014yet the city needs no defensive walls, nor standing armies, for it is guarded by something far more powerful than stone or steel.",
						"Founded by a legendary magician known as Old-Mage Jatembe, the Magaambya is the oldest academy of arcane magic in the Inner Sea region, and perhaps on all of Golarion. Looming over the city's lesser stone buildings, the academy's ring of 10 terraced towers form Nantambu's heart, each decorated with a massive mosaic of one of the legendary Ten Magic Warriors. Students from around the world come to study in its storied halls, focusing primarily on the meticulous art of wizardry. Teaching styles within the school vary greatly; some professors teach only through didactic oral traditions, while others promote the study of ancient texts\u2014many penned by Old-Mage Jatembe and his disciples. The academy's teachers are notorious for sojourning in far-off lands and visiting scholars in other nations, meaning students must sometimes travel great distances to access particular mentors. The university also encourages fieldwork, and at any given time there are more tenured professors conducting research in the far corners of the world than in the school itself. Such professors often send their favorite students abroad to secure\u2014or uncover\u2014the ruins or artifacts they hope to study. In the Magaambya, it's said that a wizard learns both by reading and by doing\u2014a philosophy sometimes termed \"the Word and the Way\"\u2014and thus to shut oneself off from the world in perpetual study is at best counterproductive, and at worst miserly. In Jatembe's tradition, study is ultimately less important than using what you learn to serve others.",
						"The Magaambyan emphasis on service is the source of Nantambu's strength, with the resident mages ensuring that no invading force has ever managed to come within 20 miles of the city. This protection extends to neighboring villages as well, and despite no formal agreements of fealty, more than a hundred such settlements gladly and gratefully pay tribute to the city. Supported by the college's faculty, Nantambu's governing council of elected magistrate-mayors presides over the city and surrounding territory, using the famous {@i Watcher's Stone} of Nantambiyan Tower to keep magical tabs on Usaro and other threats in the region.",
						"Yet Nantambu is far more than just an outgrowth of the Magaambya. Its reputation for scholarship has led to the establishment of many other prominent schools, teaching everything from science and smithing to Mwangi martial traditions. Small wonder, then, that the city should also host the largest Pathfinder Lodge in the Expanse. Famously accepting of strangers, Nantambu's populace boasts dozens of different ancestries, from Ekujae elves to Jaha lizardfolk, gnolls to catfolk. Here one can find even the most reclusive of Mwangi peoples, such as the shy anadi, many-eyed goloma, bone-feathered shisks, or inevitable-worshipping conrasu with their elaborate biological machines and living wooden exoskeletons. Regardless of their strangeness, all entities of goodwill are welcome in the Song-Wind City. This hospitality has only increased in the wake of the recent Lake Ocota land rushes, and each passing year sees the city grow more secure in its position as the cultural heart of the Expanse."

						"The city-state of Senghor has had to make significant changes as of late, most notably due to the overthrow of Sargava and subsequent establishment of Vidrian. Previously, Senghor had a degree of importance as one of the Mwangi's few remaining safe trade hubs and home of the Expanse's most powerful navy. With the fall of Sargava's colonial regime, however, some of that protection is gone, since the Free Captains who once made a tidy profit from Sargava's bribes now raid the waters around Senghor to compensate for their losses, making trade with former partners difficult. Senghor's defensive fortifications and dozens of navy ships have kept these pirates from reaching the city proper, but anyone hoping to trade with Senghor nowadays must first wind their way through Free Captain blockades\u2014a risk few are willing to take.",
						"The dominant people of Senghor, called Caldaru, are unique to this city and have a distinctly different appearance from other Mwangi peoples. They are relatively tall, with green eyes and skin tones that range from olive to dark tan. Their dialect includes several unique words and phrases not found in any other Mwangi tongue. Senghoran mythology suggests that the Caldaru trace their lineage to a Garundi ancestry that no longer exists, and the unique architecture of the city only reinforces this legend.",
						"Though Senghor once willingly traded with Sargava, the Caldaru have no interest in allowing strangers to gain a foothold in their city, so it was no surprise when they aided the Sargavan revolution to repel the Chelish colonialists. To keep things agreeable between Senghor and the new nation of Vidrian, the two have cemented a very tentative alliance, the goal of which is to keep colonizers from retaking Vidrian and to prevent any possibility of such outsiders gaining influence in Senghor. The alliance also establishes several trade and naval agreements, with the terms benefiting Senghor more than Vidrian. The people of Vidrian were grateful for Senghor's help in their young nation's earliest days, but as it has grown into its independence its citizens have begun to protest the unbalanced terms of the deal. Vidrian's leaders are pressuring Senghor in hopes of reworking the terms of agreement, but Senghor has yet to give in to these demands, heightening tensions between the two powers."

						"The grim city of Usaro looms over the delta where the Blood River meets Lake Ocota. Its ancient white ziggurats are adorned with grisly decorations made from the remains of the nation's enemies and its crumbling spires overflow with captured prisoners and slaves. Usaro was once ruled by the Gorilla King, the most favored servant of the demon lord Angazhan, but when adventurers killed the Gorilla King, the city fell to chaos. Many of the Gorilla King's minions\u2014including his derhii lieutenants, gigantopithecus advisors, and charau-ka foot soldiers, scrambled to fill the power vacuum. After several months of infighting, Kallijae elves descended upon the city, taking advantage of the disorder to liberate hundreds of the city's captives. A subsequent orc raid further splintered the city's populace, and when the orcs seized Usaro's totem of Angazhan, a minor artifact kept within the city's palace, many of the survivors claimed that the city had lost Angazhan's blessing.",
						"While the city remains in a chaotic state, a burgeoning faction seeks to unite Usaro and destroy the city's enemies. Led by a Mwangi warrior and Angazhan worshipper named Shosenbe, the group calls itself the Chosen and promises to bring vengeance against the Kallijae and orc tribes. The Chosen have so far deflected further raids on the city. However, Shosenbe is reticent about his motives and allegiances, and some wonder if he truly has ties to the demon lord Angazhan or is following his own agenda."

						"The colonial nation of Sargava faced many hardships over the past few decades, ranging from isolation from its parent nation of Cheliax to constant financial extortion by the Free Captains of the Shackles. After years of constant adversity, the locals finally chose to enact change in their lands. What began as a small revolt by Mwangi servants and slaves soon became a complete overthrow of the nation's overlords. Some of the colonists, now several generations removed from the golden age of Cheliax and disdainful of the state of Sargava at the hands of their kin, found camaraderie among the Mwangi peoples and chose to fight alongside them.",
						"The rebelling forces soon grew to massive numbers and were able to take the capital of Eleder with relative ease, displacing the domineering Baron Utilinus. Unfortunately, the rebels also had to contend with the Free Captains who had been exploiting the region. Not content to lose their easy stream of revenue in the form of protection money from Sargava, the Free Captains waged a bloody battle against the rebels, an ordeal that lasted for over a year. After countless engagements and a hastily written alliance with Senghor, the combined forces of the Mwangi and turncoat colonists successfully drove off the pirates. With the Free Captains routed, the lands became the new nation of Vidrian in 4717 AR.",
						"Today, Vidrian's people work hard to use the advantages and resources that originally drew Cheliax to colonize the region to bring the country closer to economic stability. Some use the ships seized from defeated Free Captains to trade along the western coast of Garund. Ambassadors have set out into the greater Inner Sea region to help establish diplomatic ties; they've already found success in Absalom, Andoran, Osirion, and Ravounel, and their progress shows no signs of slowing.",
						"The scars of colonization still burden the nation. Having just toppled the former rulers of Sargava, the people of Vidrian are all too aware of how easily their fledgling society could be reconquered. While all Vidrics agree that steps must be taken to rebuild their country's economy and protect the Mwangi Expanse from being colonized again, such noble goals are easier said than done. The government of Vidrian is a pragmatic collective of disparate influential powers, each with a differing idea on how to guide the country forward, and their disagreements sometimes lead to disorganized gridlock. Diplomatic overtures aimed at other Mwangi nations have been met with reluctance, as these long self-sufficient city-states have little desire to give up their complete independence. The alliance between Senghor and Vidrian remains untested, and Vidrian's other allies, such as the spiderlike anadi, are reluctant to make military commitments. Worse, Vidrian's nearest neighbor, the powerful state of Mzali, seems more inclined to view the new nation as a potential threat rather than an ally.",
						"The folk of Vidrian are a coalition of disparate Mwangi peoples, united under a common history, cause, and banner. A sizable population of former Sargavan colonists also remains in the nation, protected by law from retaliation. While their aid in the rebellion against their fellows and the Free Captains earned them citizenship, the stark change in Vidric culture that occurred after the Mwangi natives regained control of their land has resulted in a new source of friction between these two groups."

						"Infernal contracts are powerful, magical bargains that devils use to secure the souls of mortals. They are rarely offered to evil mortals, whose souls are likely damned anyway; they are primarily devices for trapping good-and neutral-aligned souls. Every infernal contract must be signed in duplicate, with one copy going to the devil and the other to the mortal. Once signed, an infernal contract is absolutely binding, taking precedence over any other magical effect or immunity, and it can be broken only under specific circumstances. All infernal contracts specify a benefit and a payment (usually the signer's soul); all terms are negotiable before the contract is signed but become irrevocable afterward. Infernal contracts can be undone by destroying both copies of the contract.",

						"Once one of the greatest human empires in Avistan, Cheliax has declined significantly in power and influence over the past century. When the god Aroden died, Cheliax collapsed into social upheaval and, shortly thereafter, civil war. Seeing an opportunity to seize power from chaos, House Thrune, which had long practiced the dark arts of diabolism in secret, entered into an open pact with the powers of Hell. Backed by legions of devils, the house's own fearsome armies, and the support of shadowcallers from the neighboring land of Nidal, House Thrune stamped out its enemies and claimed the Chelish throne. Following its victory, House Thrune ushered in sweeping changes, reshaping Cheliax into an infernal empire. Today in Cheliax, the official histories are little more than state-sanctioned propaganda, the government runs a merciless and labyrinthine bureaucracy devoted to elevating the ruthless and crushing the weak, and the once-white roses of Egorian now blossom in fields of luxurious, velvety black blossoms.",
						"Yet, for all its insistence on discipline and authority, House Thrune's rule has not gone unchallenged. The city of Westcrown, in particular, has long been home to subdued dissent and underworld corruption, which came to a head when the Council of Thieves was unmasked and broken roughly a decade ago. Even more recently, two major rebellions\u2014one successful, the other not\u2014dramatically reshaped the balance of power and weakened House Thrune's grip on the region. Nevertheless, infernal Cheliax remains an immensely wealthy, influential, and well-armed nation, and House Thrune's rule continues to guide not only its own land, but also the fates of nations beyond its borders. Isger, Nidal, and newly independent Ravounel all bear particularly tight and intricate ties with the devils' empire.",
						"Devastated by years of bitter warfare following centuries of exploitative, near-colonial rule, Isger remains a subordinate thrall to Cheliax. Its government is kept on a short leash and granted little agency to chart its own course. Out in the hinterlands, however, far from House Thrune's watchful eye, some Isgeri towns are developing their own unlikely alliances to survive.",
						"The shadowy nation of Nidal also counts itself an ally to Cheliax, but its position is nearly opposite Isger's. Steeped in millennia of sinister magic and the cruel religion of Zon-Kuthon, Nidal does not consider itself a vassal, but rather a close and valued advisor to a like-minded friend who could, perhaps, benefit from a little coaxing to become even crueler.",
						"Ravounel, by contrast, broke away from Cheliax several years ago and declared itself an independent nation. Yet even after being formally recognized as a free state, Ravounel has found that it cannot fully escape its former ruler's influence. Cheliax holds Ravounel pinned against the sea, and the old empire's economic and diplomatic domination of the region is so complete that despite having supernatural protection against direct military incursion, Ravounel must remain in Cheliax's good graces to survive. For now, House Thrune seems inclined to accept its former archduchy's independence as an unfortunate but unchallenged fact, and it has dealt fairly with Ravounel. Yet as many on both sides are well aware, a devil's mercy is fickle, and its memory long. Should a few delicate circumstances change, Ravounel's sudden independence might just as suddenly be reversed."

						"For over half a millennium, Imperial Cheliax was the dominant power across Avistan. When King Aspex the Even-Tongued broke Cheliax away from Taldor, annexed Andoran, and conquered Isger and Galt, he began a centuries-long era of glory that saw Chelish influence\u2014political, cultural, and military\u2014spread across the continent. Bolstered by the favor of Aroden, patron god of humanity, the empire ascended to become a jewel of human civilization, an honor it held unchallenged for centuries. Cheliax's golden age ended with Aroden's death. In the turmoil that followed, the diabolist House Thrune made an infernal pact with the powers of Hell, the terms of which remain shrouded in deep secrecy. The result of that grand bargain, however, still reverberates across the world. Allied with Asmodeus's legions of fiends, Queen Abrogail I seized power, beginning a dynasty that has held the Chelish throne for nearly a century.",
						"Today, Cheliax is a proud but diminished empire, renowned for its wine, opera, and glorious architecture, but also for the devils in its streets and the cruelty of its laws. Under Thrune rule, the poor are viciously oppressed, crimes are punished by agonizing public excruciations and executions, and slavery is both commonplace and harshly practiced, with none of the legal protections that existed in Aroden's day. The church of Asmodeus is the state religion, and other faiths are permitted only by House Thrune's sufferance.",
						"Yet Cheliax is also a realm of high refinement, stunning and sophisticated art, and undeniable grandeur in both public and private spaces. The polished elegance of Egorian, the bustling naval yards of Ostenso, and the aging magnificence of Westcrown\u2014even with the damage from that city's recent rebellion only partially repaired\u2014are among the wonders of human civilization. The empire's opera halls, palaces, and cathedrals are unrivaled in their splendor, even if the Asmodean cathedrals' resplendence bears a decidedly sinister cast. Cheliax's citizens tend to be ambitious, educated, and formidably intelligent; they deal with devils as equals or even treat the infernal as their lessers, never approaching the powers of Hell as abject supplicants.",
						"Not all of the empire's citizens are fond of fiends, though outsiders sometimes assume otherwise. The various orders of Hellknights model themselves after Hell's ruthless discipline and unyielding law, but they do not venerate devils and, indeed, require recruits (known as armigers) to win knighthood by slaying a devil in single combat. Additionally, Iomedae, the chivalrous goddess of crusaders, was born in Cheliax, and the Inheritor's righteous faith remains strong there, despite recent events exacerbating the long-standing strain between Iomedae's church and that of Asmodeus.",
						"Moreover, because Chelish culture values brilliance in nearly any pursuit, and because its nobles are perpetually striving for advancement against one another, it thinks itself more meritocratic than many societies on Golarion. Low-born but talented individuals can always find patrons willing to advance their careers in exchange for profits or reflected glory and can often marry or bribe their way into titles of their own in time. The Hellknights, too, offer ready advancement for those who prove themselves in service. However, Cheliax is also merciless in enforcing the downside of its \"meritocracy\": those unlucky enough to lack the qualities it values are treated as completely worthless, undeserving of even basic dignity.",
						"Furthermore, this supposed meritocracy applies only to humans. Halflings, hellspawn, and the winged strix are shut out from opportunity altogether. Chelish halflings are almost all either servants or slaves, and they are treated with peremptory disdain. Hellspawn, who are descendants of humans with fiendish blood, are held in even lower regard, for they are seen as the fruits of an abhorrent lapse in self-control while dealing with fiends. The seldom-seen strix\u2014enigmatic, black-winged humanoids\u2014are commonly considered brutes, barely even capable of language.",
						"These and other contradictions in its nature make Cheliax one of the most complicated of the world's nations. Those contradictions have only sharpened over the past decade, which has not been kind to the infernal empire. Though still mighty, Cheliax has suffered a number of stinging setbacks. It lost a major armada in the Shackles, a significant blow to Chelish naval power that put an end, at least temporarily, to Cheliax's hopes of expanding into the Mwangi Expanse. Next, a violent rebellion calling itself the Glorious Reclamation erupted in Westcrown, causing widespread social unrest before Queen Abrogail's forces were able to crush the rebels and restore order. While Iomedae's faith has not been outlawed in Cheliax following the Glorious Reclamation's defeat, it is watched much more closely, and its adherents have learned not to criticize the queen in even the mildest of terms. Simultaneously with the Glorious Reclamation, a second rebellion broke out in the Archduchy of Ravounel, which declared itself an independent nation\u2014a bitter pill that House Thrune was forced to swallow lest it suffer truly unacceptable consequences.",
						"All these blows have pushed Cheliax into a position more precarious than it has occupied since the first days of the Thrune Ascendancy. The empire's enemies, most notably Andoran, circle eagerly around it, waiting for a chance to pounce. They may find, however, that Cheliax remains a wily and dangerous adversary, and its weakness may be deliberately exaggerated as a ploy to draw in the foolish.",

						"Since its founding, Isger has been a vassal state. It was formed with Taldor's conquest of the area and, centuries later, it was annexed by Cheliax in the Even-Tongued Conquest of 4081. Unlike some of Cheliax's other holdings, Isger did not break free during the Thrune Ascendancy, and it remains in thrall today. However, there are signs that the neglect and exploitation that have long characterized Isger's relationship with its patron state are beginning to give way to a new era of closer involvement, for better and worse.",
						"The Conerica River, which bisects Isger from east to west and connects Cheliax's sea trade to Druma and Lake Encarthan, is the nation's lifeblood. The river and its support roads are key to Isger's regional importance, so most of its military is tasked with protecting the trade routes from bandits, monsters, and other dangers. Because travelers and merchants rely heavily on the Conerica and its trade roads, settlements along the river\u2014including the capital city, Elidir\u2014are not the isolated rural settlements their wooden buildings and quaint architecture might suggest. Although their pierced balusters, colorful glass-bead hangings, and brightly painted frieze boards give even the finest homes in Isger a rustic air, these towns are relatively cosmopolitan.",
						"Isger's hinterlands, however, have been less fortunate. Historically, Isger has always been something of an afterthought to its masters. Taldor and later Cheliax have held Isger as a vassal state, extracting its natural resources and talent while offering little in return. As a result, Isger has almost no industry, fortifications, or development outside the Conerica River's narrow band of prosperity. When the Goblinblood Wars of 4697 to 4701 erupted, they devastated a region that had no defense save valiant but badly overmatched local militias.",
						"The Goblinblood Wars saw hundreds of goblin tribes, led by ferocious and disciplined hobgoblin commanders, boil out of the Chitterwood and flood across Isger, destroying and devouring all in their path. Although the goblin horde was eventually driven back by an unprecedented alliance between the forces of Cheliax, Druma, and Andoran, the toll in lost Isgeri lives and wealth was enormous. Those losses continue to define much of the country. Thousands of Isgeri children were orphaned by the war, and their weak, war-ravaged government could not help them. The Church of Asmodeus stepped in to fill that need, founding a network of orphanages to cultivate its young charges in the Archfiend's unholy faith. These children begin intensive training at early ages, enabling them to quickly master difficult arts, such as the arcane fighting style practiced by the Sisterhood of the Golden Erinys.",
						"The success of the orphanages' graduates has drawn notice in Cheliax. With the old empire weakened and its enemies gathering, some Chelaxians have begun to look toward Isger both for investment opportunities and as a potential first line of defense against Andoran. The increased Chelish presence is welcomed by some and quietly resented by others, but none can deny that, perhaps for the first time, Cheliax seems to have taken a serious interest in bolstering its vassal state. There are even rumors that Isger's long-serving steward, Hedvend VI, may soon be forced to abdicate his seat. Though Hedvend has always been a loyal right hand, House Thrune has expressed impatience with his incompetence and a desire to see Isger's throne occupied by someone more capable. This rumor has mostly been met with shrugs in Isger, where Hedvend is widely regarded as a Chelish puppet who has neither the interest nor the ability to help his own people. The overgrown remains of massacred towns and unmarked graves, neglected since the Goblinblood Wars, stand as mute testament to that.",
						"The Isgeri are not, however, the only ones to carry scars from the Goblinblood Wars. The goblins themselves paid a terrible price for their short-lived triumph. Not only were they massacred by the thousands in the final battles, but the victorious armies\u2014and later, vengeful Isgeri survivors\u2014burned great swaths of the Chitterwood to destroy the goblins' homes. From these hardships, a new strain of goblin leadership has emerged. Several goblin chieftains, brighter and longer-sighted than their predecessors, have formed an alliance between their tribes and made diplomatic overtures to nearby Isgeri settlements. Given that the war's wounds remain raw, the tribes' progress is slow, but they have established some mutual defense agreements with nearby towns, and they have begun to change how goblins are perceived in the region. Isger's rural towns and villages, accustomed to making their own decisions without any help from a disinterested central government, have found some of these goblins to be more reliable allies than their own nominal lords.",
						"This shift in relations is driven by need. Undead have long bedeviled this land, particularly in remote places such as Finder's Gulch and the plague-ravaged ruins of Gillamoor, where rotting and ravening zombies stalk through the crumbling houses of the dead. Urgathoan cults proliferate among blood-soaked battlefields and the blackened remains of torched villages, feeding on the fear and pain that still linger in those haunted sites. These malign forces have grown stronger and more numerous since the Goblinblood Wars and, some say, since Tar-Baphon's rise. Whether or not that rumor is true, it is certain that neither goblins nor humans can afford to ignore the rising tide of undead in Isger's hinterlands much longer."

						"Time scarcely seems to touch the shadow-chained nation of Nidal. Ten thousand years ago, when Earthfall cast the world into darkness, three ancient horselords of Nidal threw themselves on the mercy of Zon-Kuthon, the Midnight Lord. They pledged that if the god of shadow and pain interceded to protect them, they and all their descendants would be sworn to him eternally. Zon-Kuthon accepted their bargain, gifting the trio with cursed immortality as the Black Triune and sealing Nidal's fate ever after. All Nidalese since then have been born into Zon-Kuthon's faith, and from earliest childhood they are taught that pain is sacred, suffering is joy, and their holiest duty is to endlessly refine and sharpen those sensations into sacraments.",
						"The Midnight Lord's hand lies heavy on his land. Unnatural gloom blankets Nidal, from the shade of the enormous, black-leaved trees over languidly glittering Pangolais to the perpetual storm clouds over the port city of Nisroch. Colors seem to drain away as one moves toward the heartlands of Nidal, leaving the world tinted subtly monochrome. With the presence of Zon-Kuthon so palpable throughout the nation, Nidal has never cared overmuch about either expanding or defending its territory. Its borders are divinely drawn, and they haven't changed since the days of the Black Triune's pact.",
						"The sole major interruption in Nidal's history was its conquest by Cheliax, which ushered in a period of reform and openness unusual for the insular, theocratic nation. After Aroden's death, however, the relationship between Nidal and Cheliax changed once more, with Nidal immediately throwing its full force behind House Thrune in the Chelish Civil War. Once House Thrune was firmly in power, the alliance between Nidal and the diabolist regime became stronger than ever, with agents of each country frequently serving in the other. Today, Nidalese clerics, shadowcallers, and advisors can be found throughout Cheliax and its holdings, wielding their influence to bolster House Thrune's power and thus spread holy suffering across the land.",
						"Life within Nidal, meanwhile, continues much as it always has. The Umbral Court, Nidal's shadow-touched aristocracy, governs on behalf of the Black Triune. Shadowy agents enforce the court's authority outside the major cities and abroad. The Umbral Court is heavily intertwined with Nidal's other main sources of authority\u2014Zon-Kuthon's church, the pale druids of the Uskwood, and the specialist magical academies that train Nidalese shadowcallers and shadowbinders\u2014but these organizations are distinct, albeit overlapping, and their goals sometimes conflict. This is particularly true of the Uskwood druids, who see little value in the Chelish alliance and would prefer to withdraw the government's full attention back into Nidal altogether.",
						"Farmers, fisherfolk, and artisans pay lip service to Zon-Kuthon while trying to raise their small, close-knit families in his shadow. Though many might prefer to live differently, they have been under the Midnight Lord's yoke for so long that they can imagine no other existence\u2014and hope is dangerous in this land, especially when a grim but assured peace is the alternative. The nation's long stability has allowed many families to spend generations perfecting their skills, so Nidalese glass, intricately cut jewelry, and ornamental metalwork are unsurpassed in Avistan. Additionally, because Nidal is the only civilization in the Inner Sea to have survived the destruction of Earthfall intact, it is a repository for lore that exists nowhere else in the world. To this day, scholars of history and religion make pilgrimages to the dark cities of Nidal, braving the Midnight Lord's regime in exchange for the chance to study archives unlike any other in the Inner Sea region.",
						"Far outside the cities, on the gray-grassed Atteran plains, live a hardy, proud people who are descended from the original Nidalese horselords and still observe many of their traditions. These clans are famed for the swiftness and courage of their horses, which are prized across the Inner Sea. Their heritage and cultural links to ancient Nidal grant the modern horselords a degree of freedom that no others in their shadowbound land enjoy, but even they dare not defy the Umbral Court directly. Nevertheless, the Atteran Ranches harbor many of the devotees of Desna who call themselves Dreamers. These idealists share the secret, guarded hope that, someday, it may be possible to break Zon-Kuthon's grip on their land.",
						"Nidal is also home to sizable populations of caligni, kayal (also known as fetchlings), velstracs (sinister fiends from the Shadow Plane), and light-averse undead such as vampires. Caligni are children of Old Calignos, an Azlanti settlement. They have developed their own unique traditions, pieced together from accounts of ancient Azlant, within the broader auspices of Nidalese culture. Kayal, descendants of humans who were long ago stranded on the Shadow Plane and altered by its magic, prefer to blend into human society as much as possible. Velstracs and vampires in Nidal, meanwhile, flaunt their natures openly and tend to hold privileged positions, in keeping with their power and the terror they inspire in others.",

						"The latest and most drastic shift in the Old Cheliax region is the independence of Ravounel, which seceded from Cheliax and declared itself as a free nation a few years ago. Under the leadership of Domina Jilia Bainilus, the former Lord-Mayor of Kintargo, Ravounel has threaded the delicate line between shoring up its own position as a regional power and maintaining cordial, if strained, relationships with its neighbors. Domina Bainilus must also preserve harmony between the various powers within Ravounel through diplomatic means, since she does not have the military strength to force compliance from her subjects and cannot afford to alienate any allies in the fragile new state. Although she has performed admirably so far, the difficulty of her position has increased as tensions mount between Cheliax and Andoran.",
						"Ravounel gained its independence by unusual and dramatic means. A rebel group, the Silver Ravens, uncovered a long-forgotten infernal document, the Kintargo Contract, and determined that its terms held a loophole that could be used to legally break House Thrune's grip on the Archduchy of Ravounel. The Silver Ravens deposed Paracount Barzillai Thrune, who had used his temporary seat in Kintargo to plot treason against his own house, installed Lord-Mayor Bainilus as the leader of this new nation, and worked to unite various factions within Ravounel behind her. Upon attaining office, Lord-Mayor Bainilus chose the title \"Domina,\" an old-fashioned honorific that had fallen into disuse after the Chelish Civil War.",
						"The choice of title was meant to signal both that Ravounel now stood outside House Thrune's hierarchy and that she intended to govern in keeping with old Chelish values\u2014which might be interpreted either as a subtle rebuke to House Thrune's perversion of those values, or an indication that she did not intend to repudiate Ravounel's Chelish heritage and connections. This ambiguity is deliberate, and characteristic of Ravounel's positions.",
						"Several disparate groups hold influence within Ravounel. First and foremost are the wealthy families of Kintargo, who control the shipping concerns, established industries, and domestic trade networks within the new country. Sea trade is particularly important, because the collapse of the Menador Gap has cut off land trade until Ravounel can clear the gap; this is an expensive and ongoing project, and it has spurred a certain amount of resentment toward the Silver Ravens, who won the nation's independence in part by deliberately destroying the pass to prevent Cheliax from attempting a military takeover. Now that invasion is no longer an immediate risk, many are second-guessing the costs that Ravounel incurred to prevent it.",
						"Other influential groups in the new realm include the aquatic elves of the Dismal Nitch, the strix of the Ravounel Forest, and the self-styled Kings and Queens of Vyre, the City of Masks. These last have kept Ravounel's government at a flirtatious distance, offering it sporadic and unreliable support without pledging any formal allegiance. Each of these groups offers valuable trade goods, military defenses, and regional intelligence, but none are accustomed to coordinating their interests or activities with the others. The new government of Ravounel is forever coaxing them to cooperate, and they have sometimes chafed at its demands. Meetings of the Council of Peers, as the factions' representatives are called, can be fractious.",
						"The Bellflower Network, a secretive, halfling-centric organization that smuggles escaped slaves out of Cheliax to freedom, has also developed a strong presence in Ravounel, which has outlawed slavery under the new regime. However, Ravounel's emerging status as a haven for escaped slaves has caused it quite a few headaches, as slave-hunters such as the Hellknight Order of the Chain demand the government's cooperation in apprehending fleeing slaves. An additional complication is that some Kintargan nobles, whose sympathies and business connections remain with Cheliax, have taken to kidnapping slaves and selling them back to the infernal empire. While Domina Bainilus would dearly love to put an end to this practice, she does not yet have the political or economic strength to confront these nobles, who collectively could threaten the stability of her regime.",
						"Despite this, the mood in the young country is overwhelmingly optimistic. Cheliax's most ardent loyalists have returned to their mother country, and the citizens who remain are determined to build Ravounel into a fairer and kinder society. Most of its people never believed they would live to see a day in which, after a largely bloodless revolution, they could declare their independence from the empire of devils and force House Thrune to respect that independence. If that means Ravounel must be slightly poorer and less grandiose than it was as an archduchy of Cheliax, this is little loss, for at least now its wealth and prestige can be shared more equitably among its citizens.",

Since Ravounel declared independence, Vyre's status has become even more ambiguous. The masked Kings and Queens who rule the city declared their support for Ravounel while simultaneously encouraging their Chelish visitors to continue carousing as if nothing had changed\u2014and, indeed, little seems to have changed in Vyre today. The same cruel entertainments that were available under Queen Abrogail II's rule are still performed under Domina Bainilus's flag, and the same promise of anonymity is offered to its guests. Beneath the surface, however, much is in flux. Vyre is a center of Norgorber's worship, and Vyre's current position as a playground between Cheliax and Ravounel has created a perfect opportunity for Norgorber's faithful to harvest secrets, sow betrayals, and sabotage both sides of the divide."

						"The northwestern reaches of Avistan boast vast woodlands, towering mountain ranges, sweeping deserts and tundra, and sprawling swamplands, yet not all is wilderness. Kingdoms, clans, and free cities alike can be found throughout this far-flung stretch of the Inner Sea region, each with its own traditions and legends. Indeed, the stories that come from this part of the world truly are the stuff of legends, as one might expect of a region known as the Saga Lands.",
						"The story of the Saga Lands begins well before Earthfall, when a band of exiles from the ancient nation of Azlant fled eastward and gathered here. Under the leadership of a man named Xin, these exiles founded the empire of Thassilon, which swiftly grew in power. It wasn't long before Xin's self-appointed governors, seven specialized wizards known collectively as runelords, turned against their king and assassinated him. The runelords then each seized control of one of Thassilon's nations, and in time they came to view each other as enemies. They enslaved giants to build staggering monuments, commanded dragons and monsters as specialized heroes and guardians, and ruled cruelly over the Varisian and Shoanti people whose land the runelords had claimed to build their empire.",
						"When Earthfall came, it devastated Thassilon as it did other parts of Golarion, yet the runelords had foreseen the looming catastrophe. Each developed their own solution to escape death from the apocalypse, but none of them appreciated the magnitude of the coming devastation. Though they had hoped to emerge from their shelters in the aftermath, they instead remained locked away for millennia, neither alive nor dead.",
						"In time, the legacy of Thassilon faded, and the rule of the runelords was remembered in oral traditions as something more akin to parable than actual history. The lands once dominated by the runelords were reduced to wilderness in which the survivors from Earthfall built up their own societies, while explorers and settlers from southern regions constructed cities over the ancient ruins. Today these lands host a wide range of peoples and cultures. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the right to rule and lead raids is determined by one's ability to defeat a powerful linnorm dragon in combat. East of this, in the nation of Irrisen, generations of witches descended from a legend hold the reins of rule, and winter is a constant presence. The Realm of the Mammoth Lords occupies the northeastern portion of the Saga Lands, past the reaches of the ancient Thassilonian empire, and is home to valiant warriors who ride megafauna into battle. In the southern extent, the frontier realm known as Varisia, once the heart of Thassilon itself, has seen new sagas to rival any that have come before.",
						"In recent years, Varisia and Irrisen alike have seen tumult and change. In Irrisen, the cycle of rule by a cabal of winter witches has been disrupted, and none can say where the land's new queen aims to take her country. Meanwhile, Varisia has witnessed the rise of Thassilon's runelords from the forgotten past. Heroes stepped in to first defeat one runelord, and then most of the other runelords who followed."

						"The nation of Irrisen is known throughout the Inner Sea region as a land of magic and wonder, an enchanted place where winter is constant, wild animals can talk, and mysterious spellcasters known as the winter witches rule. Yet none of these stories make any pretense that Irrisen is a place of comfort and delight. The stories of Irrisen's sagas are told to children by parents as parables\u2014they must mind their elders and be good, lest the winter witches snatch them away and feed them to their true leader, the legendary Queen of Witches: Baba Yaga. In the case of Irrisen, these childhood fairy tales are even more accurate than one might think.",
						"Baba Yaga herself exists, but she does not hail from Golarion. She traveled to Avistan nearly 1,400 years ago from a distant, unknown world and subjugated a portion of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings during a particularly harrowing and brutal winter, claiming the land as her own. She killed all who resisted and enslaved those who did not. Her conquest of Irrisen took a mere 23 days, and the nation has remained locked in the throes of winter ever since.",
						"For many of those years, Irrisen has clashed with its western neighbor, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Memories of defeat linger in that proud nation, and even as the centuries wore on, the Linnorm Kings and their subjects could not forget the swift and humiliating defeat Baba Yaga handed them during those 23 days. The border between the two nations has long been fraught with fighting and intrigue, but the wards protecting Irrisen are as potent as their witch leaders.",
						"Baba Yaga herself did not linger after her triumph. As if the act of conquering the land were all that mattered, she left its rule in the hands of one of her daughters, a cruel witch who was promised eternal youth in return for keeping the nation safe and secure. Every 100 years, though, Baba Yaga returned to reclaim the ruling queen, taking that daughter away to accompany her on her journeys to other worlds and leaving a new daughter installed on the throne.",
						"After 13 queens, this pattern collapsed. The fourteenth ruling daughter was a woman named Elvanna, said to be the most cruel of a long line of cruel queens. As the time of Baba Yaga's return drew near, Elvanna grew more and more convinced that she deserved to remain Irrisen's ruler forever. When her mother arrived, Elvanna triggered a devious trap and captured Baba Yaga, then turned her magic toward spreading the curse of winter to other lands. Only the timely intervention of a band of heroes halted her plot, freed Baba Yaga, and saw Elvanna's defeat. Today, for the first time since its founding, Irrisen is ruled by someone other than a winter witch, yet this should not necessarily be taken as a hopeful sign. Queen Anastasia may be young, but as an exile of the same world her ancient grandmother Baba Yaga hailed from, she has the potential to wield great power. Just how she will choose to exert this power in her stewardship over Irrisen has yet to be unveiled. Certainly, Irrisen is no safer a place today than it has been for centuries, and with rumbles of embittered witches who regard Queen Anastasia as the \"Fraud Queen,\" it remains to be seen if her rule will match the century-long reigns of her 14 aunts.",
						"Today, Irrisen remains in the grip of unending ice and snow. Even Baba Yaga herself seems unable, or at least unwilling, to end the reign of winter within the land. As such, the land remains eternally frozen, with frost goblins, winter wolves, ice trolls, and all manner of rime-coated fey posing common threats to those who have little other choice but to keep their heads low and their minds focused on simply making it one day at a time. That the first few years of Queen Anastasia's rule have resulted in less agony for the land's citizens is not taken as indication of a blissful future. Life in Irrisen has always been tough, and many still feel that the new queen's kindness is a cruel trick intended to grant hope only to rip it away just as the citizens start to trust again. And beyond the dissidents and spurned witch relations of the prior ruling castes plotting intrigue and fomenting rebellion, there is always the threat to the west of the Linnorm Kingdoms\u2014memories of defeat still linger there, and with an untested queen on the throne, it may be only a matter of a few months before a new invasion begins.",

						"As in so many other regions along the northern edge of Avistan, life is hard for the people of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. What land that isn't frozen marsh is heavily strewn with stones and boulders\u2014starvation is thus a constant threat in the barren winter months. Traditionally, the people of the Linnorm Kingdoms fought against the cruel specter of hunger by taking to the seas in their distinctive longships, engaging in violent coastal raids along Avistan's extensive western coastline in order to secure valuable plunder and supplies. As the centuries wore on and the lands to the south grew more heavily populated, more organized, and thus more dangerous to raid, many of the Linnorm Kingdoms turned in their swords and shields for the tools of trade, and their long trips south sought to secure mercantile alliances rather than blood-won conquest. Yet some of the Kingdoms found such changes to tradition as dishonorable to their ancestors, and others simply preferred the act of raiding to the pursuit of trade.",
						"The harsh land and harsher winters are far from the only dangers in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Vast reaches of wilderness, ranging from rocky tundra to tangled forest to rugged hills, cut wide swaths between the settled reaches of the kingdoms, and in these lands dwell monsters. Capricious fey are common in these places, as are bloodthirsty trolls and murderous giants, strangely enchanted animals that can both plead for their lives and utter dire curses, and the unquiet spirits of the restless dead who haunt the places where they fell. The most dangerous are linnorms\u2014primordial dragons of vast size and great strength. Facing a linnorm in combat is folly for all but the most formidable warriors, and even in death these mighty dragons bestow hideous curses that can linger for a lifetime in the flesh and bones of their killers. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, however, anyone who aspires to rightfully rule a kingdom must seek out a linnorm, confront it, and defeat it in combat.",
						"Sometimes, this violent rite breeds controversy. For example, none saw King Opir Eightfingers slay his linnorm\u2014he merely returned to the city of Jol with a severed linnorm's head, already decaying, as proof of his deed. Those who whispered that Opir found a dead linnorm and absconded with its head learned to keep their suspicions quiet after enough grisly and very public executions. When New Thassilon rose along the Linnorm Kingdom's southern borders, King Opir made his final mistake and launched an ill-advised series of raids against the holdings of Runelord Belimarius. His defeat left his kingdom without a leader, although none found Opir's body among the dead in the battlefield. Some say the fallen king languishes in a hidden dungeon somewhere in the island reaches of western New Thassilon, while others whisper that he fled to the mountains and even now is building a new army and will soon return to his place on the throne. That Opir left behind no friends interested in looking into his disappearance or seeking a potential resurrection only further deepens the mystery of his fate.",
						"Elsewhere in the Linnorm Kingdoms, King White Estrid upended tradition by subjugating a linnorm upon defeating it and taking it into her service instead of slaying it. Her mercy toward the linnorm Boiltongue was met initially with skepticism, but her enemies quickly learned that a ruler with a linnorm to back her demands is mighty indeed. King Thira Ash-Eyes was less merciful to her linnorm foe, killing the beast and then claiming the throne in the region's capital of Kalsgard after her father, King Sveinn Blood-Eagle, set sail to the west on a quest to retire to the afterlife in legendary Valenhall. The Varki ranger Nankou caused a stir by taking the title of linnorm king in Icemark, shocking many Ulfen warriors\u2014though none can dispute the new king's triumph over a linnorm, most Ulfen never expected one of the Varki people to claim what they consider to be an Ulfen title. The most recent king to take a throne is the legendary adventurer Ostog the Unslain, who claimed the throne of Jol after Opir's disappearance. Whether Ostog can keep his title of Unslain for long while holding his throne, only time can tell."

						"Runelord Karzoug was the first of Thassilon's seven runelords to wake after thousands of years in stasis, trapped just beyond the borders of reality until an unwitting stone giant wizard set in motion the process enabling the runelord's return. A band of heroes stood against Karzoug and his giant armies and defeated him, and in the process resurrected the legacy of Thassilon. When the revelation spread through Avistan that Varisia was once the site of a powerful and ancient empire of wizards that had been lost to time, adventurers, explorers, scholars, and investigators came from far and wide to study and learn more about Thassilon.",
						"Leaders among Varisia's city-states grew worried, though, for seven runelords had vanished at Earthfall, and if only one rising from slumber could wreak so much havoc, what then would happen if the others rose as well? At their urging, a new band of heroes sought out an ancient artifact, the seven-pointed {@i Sihedron}, and rebuilt it from its shattered parts. Originally created by Thassilon's founder, the mighty wizard Xin, the {@i Sihedron} held within it the secrets of Thassilonian magic and would be a valuable defense against the other runelords should the time come.",
						"Yet when the other runelords inevitably began to rise, Varisia's reigning heroes and the {@i Sihedron} alike vanished without a trace. A new band of heroes rose to face the challenge, discovered the Sihedron's fate, stood against Runelord Alaznist, and prevented her from altering time itself to turn the Saga Lands into an empire of pain and wrath. But the heroes needed help to achieve this goal, and they found it in the most unlikely of places\u2014Runelord Sorshen.",
						"Once the ruler of Eurythnia along Varisia's southern coast, Sorshen was one of the most powerful of the seven runelords, and after the events of the recent return of the runelords settled, she was one of only two who survived. Sorshen and her counterpart, Runelord Belimarius, went on to claim a swath of thinly inhabited land along the northern edge of Varisia consisting primarily of the towering Kodar Mountains. This became New Thassilon.",
						"The land of New Thassilon itself is further divided into two smaller kingdoms. Sorshen rules Eurythnia, the larger of the two, but her rule over this land is light and her involvement in the life of this land's subjects subtle. Working as her adviser and benefactor is her once-demonic patron Nocticula, a newly ascended divinity associated with midnight, exiles, and artists. Together they seek to fashion Eurythnia and, in time, all of New Thassilon into a place where those with no other land to call their own can seek shelter, an asylum state for exiled politicians, subversive artists, and misfits of society. As queen of Eurythnia, Sorshen has abandoned the trappings of runelord and does not seek to follow in the footsteps of her fellows Karzoug and Alaznist. She's seen their attempts at rule by force fail and has realized that the world has moved on since Thassilon's fall. Wiser and accepting of this change, Queen Sorshen seeks to build New Thassilon into a place that can exist peacefully alongside its neighbors.",
						"This view is not shared by her co-ruler to the west. Runelord Belimarius continues to be poisoned by the sting of envy, despite mercy and understanding from the heroes who could have destroyed her. She seems incapable of looking upon her neighbors' holdings without jealousy, despite the fact that her own power remains great. Her first major act as ruler was a short but pivotal war with King Opir Eightfingers, whose realm in the Linnorm Kingdoms lay just north of her own. Her defeat of this unpopular ruler ironically cast her in a more favorable light, yet the gratitude of those who had grown tired of Opir's posturing is likely to be short-lived. Sorshen knows Belimarius is an unstable element and may be the greatest threat to her hopes of New Thassilon finding a more peaceful position in the Saga Lands. Though resigned that it's simply a matter of time before something must be done about her rival, Sorshen nevertheless abstains from dissenting publicly, allowing Belimarius to forge her own fate.",
						"One significant development among the citizens of New Thassilon is the evolution of the title of \"runelord\" itself. In ancient Thassilon, only seven at a time held this title\u2014it was synonymous with \"governor\" or \"ruler\" as much as it indicated mastery over arcane magic. But now, many have begun to explore and examine what it meant to be a runelord. In time, the notion of runelord may well make the transition from a governmental title to a widespread term. One of this movement's most vocal and compelling leaders is a woman named Aethusa, the so-called \"Thrice-born Queen,\" who claims to be the reincarnation of not one but two runelords of old."

						"The hearty folk of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are surrounded by upheaval. To the west, the land of Irrisen recently lost its queen and is in the middle of the first significant change in the inheritance of power in 14 centuries. To the south, the orcs of Belkzen seem on the cusp of transitioning from a more warlike and brutal way of life into something new, with their refusal to rejoin the ranks of their one-time oppressor Tar-Baphon as a potential catalyst. But it was to the east that the biggest change surrounding this realm took place, for here, with the closing of the Worldwound, the Mammoth Lords have less to worry about with each passing day. Every demon slaughtered now lessens the whole, whereas before it seemed as if untold more sprang from the rift between worlds with each minor victory. The Mammoth Lords are proud that through it all, life in their lands has remained largely unchanged. They point to this as a strength, seeing it as proof that their ways and traditions have not only withstood the test of time, but vanquished it. And while there is wisdom in these beliefs, there is also bravado, for not all is safe and sound in this rugged landscape.",
						"One need look no further than the Mammoth Lords themselves\u2014various bands of nomadic Kellids\u2014for proof of the land's dangers, for the Mammoth Lords are very much a product of this region. Here, megafauna of all sorts live wild, from armored glyptodons and giant ground sloths to ravenous cave bears and smilodons. None are larger or mightier than the mammoths that travel the plains of this land in vast herds.",
						"The Mammoth Lords earned their name by mastering these elephantine creatures, as well as many other types of megafauna. These animals serve the Mammoth Lords as mounts, guardians, and engines of war. The Mammoth Lord clans have no central organization and instead gather along extended family lines; occasionally multiple families join together as followings. The followings keep territories that often clash with others, but they have no true capital city. Now that the orcs have grown more peaceful, Irrisen has gained a potentially gentler queen, and the Worldwound has healed, these clashes are growing. Some of the wiser among the Mammoth Lords see that the lack of conflicts along the borders has left the more violent-minded of the various followings without real enemies to face, leaving them to invent conflicts with each other.",
						"Traditionally, the Mammoth Lords have had another sort of enemy closer to home\u2014the frost giants. But as with the more distant dangers, the giants have seemed to fade rom view. The prouder of the Mammoth Lords attribute this too to the superiority of their way of life, bragging that giants can witness \"smaller folk\" defeating their kin in battle only so many times before they retreat for good.

						"The giants have not vanished, though. The greatest among them, Jarl Gnargorak, is no fool, but neither is he kind and forgiving. He and his frost giants have clashed against the Mammoth Lords his entire life, and the voices of his ancestors remind him that this has always been the way of things. Jarl Gnargorak foresees a day in the not-so-distant future when his people rule this land, and the Mammoth Lords are extinct. For now, this canny leader has ordered his armies far into the Tusk Mountains to hunker and remain in quiet wait. He knows the Mammoth Lords see the victories along their borders as engendering weakness and that they claim responsibility for changes beyond their borders that were not directly due to the Mammoth Lords' actions\u2014that they have benefited from the acts of outside heroes. And so Jarl Gnargorak waits for the followings to grow fat and lazy, at which time he will march his armies down from the frozen mountain heights to claim the lands he sees as rightfully belonging to the Jotun."

						"While the other realms of the Saga Lands may have longer histories as established nations, the stories of recent years have catapulted the wilder reaches of Varisia into modern awareness. Much of Varisia's ancient past, when it formed the bulk of the empire of Thassilon, has only recently been rediscovered by modern historians and scholars. And while Cheliax toyed for a few years at expanding its reach into this land, today Varisia is largely in the control of three other groups. The most widespread of these groups is a motley collection of pilgrims and travelers from all corners of the world, resulting in a wide diversity among the cities in Varisia.",
						"But while many of these relative newcomers have dwelt in Varisia for several generations, they are still regarded at best as \"new blood\" by the land's indigenous Varisian and Shoanti people. For Varisians, the integration of the newcomers was marred by numerous clashes between cultures, with prejudice and misunderstandings making initial attempts to live and work together choppy, but when compared to the Shoanti experience, the Varisians' interactions seem almost idyllic. The Shoanti had always had a smaller footprint in their ancestral lands than the Varisians, and while Varisians are traditionally nomadic, the Shoanti were more prone to settling down, living in clan-based groups known as quahs. When Cheliax founded a colony named Korvosa along a large bay in the heart of Shoanti lands, which contained a strange and ancient pyramid sacred to the Shoanti, violence erupted between the Chelish colonizers and the displaced Shoanti. After a prolonged and bloody conflict, the colonizers ultimately won; the bay is now known as Conqueror's Bay, and Korvosa is the largest city in Varisia. The Shoanti of the region were forced to abandon their homeland and relocate to the north, into the harsh wilds known as the Cinderlands. Prejudice against Shoanti is rife in Korvosa to this day, and the displaced Shoanti have not forgiven the Chelish invaders.",
						"Geographically, Varisia is divided into two distinct regions. The northeastern portion is plateau, and the southwestern portion is lowlands, consisting of a mix of forested mountains, lush grasslands, verdant forests, and sprawling swamps. In the eastern lowlands, the city of Korvosa is by far the largest settlement. The city has proudly clung to the traditions of its Chelish founders, but those traditions were challenged recently when Queen Ileosa Arabasti gained control after the sudden death of her husband. At first, the people of Korvosa worried that she was ill-equipped to rule, but soon they learned quite the opposite: Ileosa was filled with ambition equaled only by her cruelty, and she proved to be a deadly tyrant indeed. Her rule was relatively short and ended violently, but her time in control has changed Korvosa forever. Thousands died during her regime\u2014many to the ravages of a disease known as bloodveil, a disease Ileosa helped to spread\u2014and her one-time guards, the Gray Maidens, fractured into competing mercenary bands after her defeat.",
						"In the western lowlands, the greatest city is Magnimar, founded by expatriates from Korvosa at the site of an ancient Thassilonian monument\u2014a crumbled bridge known as the Irespan. Well to the north of Magnimar, the region's third-largest city is a haven for pirates and other scoundrels: Riddleport. However, the small town of Sandpoint may well be the most influential in the land, for not one but three legendary groups of heroes got their start from this coastal town. The first of these groups defeated Runelord Karzoug, while the second (of which Ostog the Unslain was a member) eventually traveled to distant Osirion before splitting apart to each forge their own stories throughout the Inner Sea region. The third group escorted local barkeep Ameiko Kaijitsu over the Crown of the World, where they aided her in reclaiming her birthright to become empress of the nation of Minkai.",
						"The greatest danger Varisia has faced in recent years only recently came to pass. Events set in motion 10 years before by Runelord Karzoug's awakening came to a head as several other runelords rose and fought for dominance. One of the most powerful of their number, Runelord Alaznist, seized control of an ancient artifact that allowed her to manipulate time. If not for the intervention of yet another group of heroes with roots in Varisia, Alaznist would have transformed the Saga Lands into her own rune-blasted, devastated empire.",
						"All of these adventurers have left such a significant mark on the world that one could argue Varisia's most potent and important exports to the Inner Sea region are in fact its heroes. Yet Varisia also seems to produce no shortage of epic dangers that require equally epic solutions. Only time can reveal who might be the next great villains\u2014and their heroic counterparts."

While Taldan influence is still heavy across the region\u2014from ethnicity and language to cultural traditions and even infrastructure\u2014the area was already home to many before Taldor's Azlanti progenitors settled here. Humans of the Kellid ethnicity, along with elves, dwarves, and gnomes, made their homes here in ages past, and their descendants remain to this day, having witnessed the rise and fall of heroes, empires, and even gods.",
						"Earthfall left its mark on this region, as it did on others. The elves, having some foreknowledge of the disaster, fled through their magical portals called {@i aiudara} to the realm of Sovyrian, leaving only a small number behind to eke out a living on the ruined world. It was during this time that the dwarves undertook their Quest for Sky, emerging from their underground homes to found the nation of Tar Taargadth\u2014and driving orcs onto the surface ahead of them. Not long after, gnomes fleeing some unknown terror from the First World arrived via planar portals, settling in this region's rich, wild woodlands. Only as humanity began to recover from the Age of Darkness did refugees from old Azlanti bloodlines join with local Garundi, Keleshites, and Kellids to carve out homes along the northwestern border of the Inner Sea. Centuries later, First Emperor Taldaris unified these city-states to found what would become Taldor, the largest human empire in Avistan.",
						"The thousands of years since Taldor's founding have shaped the region in countless ways. When Aroden became a god and raised the Isle of Kortos from the sea, his worship was centered in Taldor's capitol, Oppara. It was the Taldan Empire that led the Shining Crusade to resist and eventually imprison the Whispering Tyrant. But the empire was not infallible, and over time portions of the empire broke away. Elves returning from Sovyrian reclaimed Kyonin as their own, and the dwarves of the Five Kings Mountains retained their autonomy despite their own internal turmoil. Just how weak the empire had grown was revealed when its western holdings revolted, breaking off to become the empire of Cheliax in a relatively peaceful secession. The death of the god Aroden and the subsequent strife within Cheliax sparked further divisions, as the lands of Galt and Andoran, though partners in their succession from Cheliax and founded on similar philosophies, diverged in practice, with the latter establishing a functioning democracy while the former struggles in perpetual revolution. Even those lands that Taldor managed to retain have seen tremendous change over the centuries, most recently with the crowning of the realm's first grand princess."

						"Perhaps due to its youth, Andoran keeps a close eye on its neighbors. Taldor's revitalization under Grand Princess Eutropia is not as welcome in Andoran as in other countries: despite Eutropia's many reforms and improved diplomacy, she's still a hereditary monarch who prevented a people's rebellion. Andoran has also taken note of Cheliax's recent weaknesses, and rumors abound that the two nations may be headed for war\u2014a sentiment encouraged by Andoran's leader, Supreme-Elect Andira Marusek, a retired general of the Steel Falcons known for her opposition to the Chelish slave trade. Last but not least, prudence leads Andoran to carefully observe the follies of its cousin nation of Galt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, lest bloody revolution undermine all that Andoran has achieved over the past decades.",

The Golden Legion is composed of elite soldiers who fight alongside Andoran's standing military. The Steel Falcons (and their naval counterparts, the Gray Corsairs) operate independent of the regular military, specializing in battling slavery and tyranny both at home and abroad. Most secretive of the knights are the Twilight Talons, who provide intelligence and espionage for a government that officially disavows any knowledge of their existence.",

Renowned across the Inner Sea region, the innocuous-sounding Lumber Consortium was originally a criminal syndicate predating Andoran's independence, and the consortium's financial influence remains unparalleled.

These plains and forests were first home to one of the oldest Kellid cultures on Avistan, along with a sizable fey contingent in the central Palakar Forest. Once the dwarves emerged, the region became a holding of the Five Kings Mountains, remaining so until 2332 AR, when the signing of the historic Kerse Accord simultaneously ended 700 years of dwarven civil war, gained Druma its independence, and proved once and for all the economic mastery of the Prophets of Kalistrade.",
						"To say Druma is run by the Prophets of Kalistrade\u2014a Druman pseudo-religious group infamous for their strict self-denial and ceaseless pursuit of wealth\u2014is only partially correct. Technically, the Resplendent Bureaucracy\u2014a body of hundreds of civic administrators\u2014governs the nation, and membership in the Prophets of Kalistrade imparts no official governmental power. In practice, however, the tremendous financial resources under the Kalistocrats' control grant them more influence than that wielded by the official government. Furthermore, the Kalistocrats themselves are led by a High Prophet who legally has the authority to countermand the Bureaucracy's rulings. The current high prophet, Kelldor, leverages powerful divination abilities and a sharp acumen to all but predict the future, and has used his power to build relationships with the rulers of several Inner Sea nations.",
						"While the white-robed Kalistocrats are recognized throughout the Inner Sea, Druma's military is equally well known. Formally the Mercenary League, the organization and its members are generally referred to as \"Blackjackets\" due to their iconic all-black uniforms. Given their status as the army of a nation of phenomenally wealthy traders, the Blackjackets are outfitted with the highest quality armor and weaponry and receive some of the best training\u2014and highest pay\u2014of any Inner Sea military. As a result, the Blackjackets' loyalty to the Resplendent Bureaucracy is legendary, and individual Blackjackets are decidedly and unhesitatingly amoral when carrying out their orders.",
						"The current power of the Blackjackets can be attributed to High Prophet Kelldor, who began building up the Mercenary League 2 years ago with an \"Edict of Preparation\"\u2014orders to nearly double the army's recruitment and training. The result has been an enormous force of highly skilled warriors with specialized training to combat orcs and undead, putting Druma in a unique position to weather the return of the Whispering Tyrant. As a result, the nation has not suffered as much as its neighbors from the rise of Tar-Baphon, though as lucrative trade routes have been choked off\u2014particularly along Lake Encarthan\u2014some citizens have begun to worry that the legions of undead may be a problem that not even money can solve.",
						"In the meantime, the Kalistocrats maintain their lucrative trade networks, welcoming the opportunity to increase trade with Kyonin and jockeying to establish themselves as a primary conduit between the elven nation and the rest of the world. Some attempt to force alliances with Galt's new leadership in hopes that stability in that nation will prove more profitable, while others simply conduct what trade they can in basic supplies and armaments. Ultimately, Druma has changed little in response to recent events, with its citizens reminding each other that, regardless of who wears the crown in neighboring nations, money remains everyone's king."

						"Dwarves first emerged onto Golarion's surface from the depths of the Five Kings Mountains. Looking out from those craggy peaks at an endless alien sky, their leaders understood for the first time just how tenuous and vulnerable their people would be in this strange land. Thus they built Highhelm, the first and greatest of their Sky Citadels, finding safety and familiarity in its stone halls and clever fortifications. From here, the kingdom of Tar Taargadth spread across the surface of Avistan, growing powerful and fruitful during the Age of Anguish. Yet it was not to last: in the millennia that followed, many subsequent Sky Citadels were lost or conquered, their territories increasingly invaded by orcs and humans, until in 1551 AR the kingdom finally collapsed. In its place rose the five fractious, smaller kingdoms that gave the mountain range its current name. These in turn fell to civil war and invasion, their communities growing small and insular. Today, the region still lacks a single central government, and while High King Borogrim the Hale convenes the Gathering Council among the region's leaders, and many dwarves across the Inner Sea region view the mountain range as an ancestral homeland, it's been over 250 years since the dwarves of these mountains could be said to be a single people.",
						"Despite this, the dwarves' longstanding traditions have given their society tremendous stability. In addition to resisting invasion from without, they've weathered their own struggles from within, most notably the societal decline following the eruption of Droskar's Crag in 3980 AR, during which much craft and culture was lost as the dwarves of the region turned to the worship of Droskar under Ordrik Talhrik. Since Ordrik's fall 250 years ago, the dwarves of the region have revived many of their ancient ways. Today, the Five Kings Mountains are the center of a growing dwarven renaissance, as Five Kings dwarves begin to reestablish contact with other dwarven nations isolated by the fall of Tar Taargadth, or adopt ancient dwarven magical practices such as those of the shamanic Rivethun. This newfound confidence in dwarven culture has also led to increased traffic with the neighboring elven realm of Kyonin, and the ensuing surge of collaboration between artisans continues to produce works of unparalleled beauty and function.",
						"The major settlements of Larrad, Highhelm, Kovlar, Taggoret, Rolgrimmdur, and Tar-Kazmukh have remained relatively safe and stable despite recent upheavals in nearby nations. Tradition and stability don't translate to ignorance or naiveté, though. The dwarves keep a wary eye on Tar-Baphon, the increased tensions between Cheliax and Andoran, the Ironfang hobgoblins, and even the newly established realm of New Thassilon. The cities here have maintained strong trade relations with neighboring nations, particularly mercantile Druma but also Andoran, Isger, and Taldor. Trade with Galt has largely ceased with that nation's fall into chaos, though some merchants have no qualms about selling equipment to the Gray Gardeners or resistance fighters.",
						"Much of society in the Five Kings Mountains involves the worship of the traditional dwarven gods. While Torag is generally recognized as the foremost dwarven god, he is but one of a larger dwarven pantheon: Magrim and Angradd watch over battles, with many mentor-mentee relationships holding these two up as a model, though Trudd is popular among more impulsive youths. Folgrit represents mothers, wives, daughters, and those who provide emotional labor, while dwarves look to Bolka for aid in matters of the heart\u2014which, like emotional labor, is seen as a challenge and vocation comparable to battle and forge-work. Those dwarves who facilitate relationships and serve as diplomats and ambassadors to other nations look to Grundinnar for guidance and support. Kols is the subject of much respect and is invoked in formal oaths, such as the common phrase \"Kols witness these words.\" Of the larger dwarven pantheon, only Dranngvit and Droskar are rarely worshipped, though they are still recognized as necessary\u2014albeit unsavory\u2014parts of lived experience, and therefore the pantheon."

What was once a society known for brilliant poets, artists, and philosophers flared into rebellion under Thrune-controlled Cheliax, but while Andoran managed to follow its democratic ideals into peace, Galt is now inhabited by mobs of paranoid, revolutionary fanatics. The nation's out-of-control radicals have overthrown the institution of nobility and most other institutions along with it, and Galt's bastions of education have been converted to political prisons. More than a dozen governments have come and gone in the 50 years since the initial revolution, with none able to govern effectively or hold control for more than a few years. Infrastructure and social support systems fell by the wayside, leading to widespread poverty and displaced citizens, banditry, and unchallenged attacks by fell beasts.",
						"The current Revolutionary Council has existed for longer than most of Galt's regimes, though it shows signs of its own impending collapse. For more than a decade, Citizen Korran Goss held the council together through a talent for redirecting the mob's rage away from himself and the council, blaming neighboring nations for Galt's troubles. But like so many leaders before him, Korran found himself the target of a ruthless campaign of violence that even his tremendous force of personality could not turn aside. The Revolutionary Council is now headed by Citizen Camilia Drannoch, a populist leader who insists that Korran's habit of blaming external forces for Galt's failings only led to a worsening of its condition. Under her leadership, the Revolutionary Council has ostensibly begun a campaign to root out rogue elements and destabilizing influences within Galt, though in many cases this effort has merely allowed Camilia to manipulate the mob into removing those who would threaten her position.",
						"There have been only two constant factors in Galt since its fall into chaos: the Gray Gardeners and the guillotines known as the {@i final blades}. The Gray Gardeners are Galt's executioners, an order of masked enforcers based in the city of Litran. Anonymity is the key to the Gray Gardeners' safety and their power, as they can act as faceless arms of the Galtan mob, yet their power is such that no individual dares risk their ire out of fear of experiencing the {@i final blades} firsthand. The guillotines hold powerful enchantments that trap their victims' souls, lest the condemned be revived through magic or delivered into the clutches of Chelish devils. These instruments of death have proven impervious to physical harm, though rumors have begun circulating in Isarn that underground agents have finally found a ritual to destroy the {@i final blades} and release all of the souls trapped within.",
						"Galt has few relationships with any other nations or organizations. Envoys from Kyonin have recently established a modest presence in Isarn, and the Pathfinder Society maintains a small, secretive lodge in Woodsedge, but most nations view Galt as a kind of a disease, watching from afar and hoping its chaos doesn't spread. Taldor is still reeling from its own revolution scare during the convoluted succession from Grand Prince Stavian III to Grand Princess Eutropia, and Andoran upholds Galt as a cautionary tale, as both nations were founded upon the same principles."

						"Although many people in the Inner Sea region see the elves of Kyonin as standoffish and isolationist\u2014a stereotype unintentionally reinforced by the elves' long focus on various internal struggles\u2014the newly returned threat of Tar-Baphon has drawn the elves' attention outward once more. Elven experts' own experience and historical records suggest that it's only a matter of time before Tar-Baphon becomes an unavoidable threat to the entire region, and thus Kyonin's leadership has begun sending more diplomatic emissaries to other nations in preparation for a large-scale war that could ravage the continent. At the same time, this need for greater cooperation with other nations has led Kyonin's leaders to open their own carefully watched borders to ambassadors and visitors from a wide array of ancestries and nations.",
						"This elven push for international alliance is seen by many as a drastic change from Kyonin's traditional policy, yet elven records and memories reveal many instances of similar collaboration against evil, now long forgotten by younger nations. Still, the elven love of freedom means that many of these efforts are the acts of like-minded individuals rather than ruling institutions\u2014in truth, even the elves' current undertakings are less the result of a formal governmental order and more a collective drive among individuals to work toward the greater good. The fact that Kyonin's assistance is almost never a national decision, but instead the independent undertaking of numerous individuals, has given rise to the widespread opinion that elves as a whole care little for the other nations of Avistan. The recent destruction of Lastwall has rallied many younger elves into action, hoping to combat their nation's reputation for ambivalence as well as the Whispering Tyrant.",
						"Despite a heightened involvement on the global stage, life in Kyonin has changed little over the centuries. The elves continue their appreciation of deep learning, crafting, and the arcane arts, though the influx of outsiders into the realm has led to the introduction of new ideas that diverge from purely elven tradition. Elves' apparent disinterest and detachment belie a keen eye on current events, a shifting political landscape, and growing and changing threats on a global and long-term scale. Even within the courts of Queen Telandia Edasseril, intrigue abounds as disparate factions vie for influence, and not all players agree with the decision to allow outsiders into the realm. Likewise, even this increased outreach has not overcome longstanding rivalries: Kyonin remains at odds with the River Kingdoms, especially regarding the human-occupied elven ruin of Sevenarches, and Razmiran's hostile policy toward the elves has caused an ongoing cold war across the West Sellen River.",
						"Those groups who question the wisdom of allowing outsiders into Kyonin have been most convincing with regard to the Fierani Forest, and especially the capital of Iadara, where several {@i aiudara}\u2014elf gates\u2014link the elven realm to distant lands, and where the Sovyrian Stone that powers all {@i aiudara} is carefully hidden away. For this reason, parts of the city remain swathed in illusion and supernatural mists to deter non-elven visitors from straying from their designated areas. Ironically, many of these same groups worried about the safety of the elven capital also appreciate the influx of non-elven warriors from the north, who bring experience rom the demon-hunting Mendevian crusades that may be crucial in elven efforts to contain the threat of Treerazer in Kyonin's southern reaches.",

								"The elves' long retreat to Sovyrian during the Age of Darkness may have saved their people, but their escape left their ancestral lands to rot and ruin. During their absence, the nascent demon lord Treerazer claimed much of Kyonin, twisting and perverting its sylvan majesty, culminating in an attempt to warp the Sovyrian Stone itself into a permanent portal to the Abyss. Fortunately for Golarion, this last atrocity was detected before it could succeed, prompting the elves to return to Golarion en masse in a ferocious counterattack. In the centuries to follow, elven forces drove the nascent demon lord from the heart of their realm, sequestering him in a vast swamp they dubbed Tanglebriar. Yet in spite of their migration back to the world they'd abandoned and their reforged ties with humanity and other nations, they've remained unable to destroy Treerazer completely or force him out of their lands.",
								"While few elves would say their conflict with Treerazer has been a success, most acknowledge that the threat the demon lord poses has been largely contained. Of late, elven forces have gained reinforcements as some crusaders from the Worldwound chose to join in the efforts against Treerazer rather than continuing south to confront Tar-Baphon, giving defenders renewed hope that victory may finally be within sight.",
								"The guardians of Tanglebriar cannot rest easy, however. Threats still creep from the swamp with deadly regularity, in the form of demons, dark fey, carnivorous fungi, and several cults that worship the nascent demon lord. Additionally, Treerazer is the son of the demon lord of fungus and parasites Cyth-V'sug, and though the two are estranged, the waning of Cyth-V'sug's influence in Fangwood Forest and the Worldwound has stirred fears that the two might reconcile. United, the two demon lords might have the strength to launch an offensive to take control of all Kyonin and beyond. Worse yet, either might form an alliance with Tar-Baphon, a possibility that has scouts and skirmishers on a perpetual lookout."

						"Taldor is one of the oldest nations in the Inner Sea region, at one point having held the majority of Avistan under the Lion Throne's control. The empire's history of expansion, military might, and heroic glory are baked into its citizens' self-image, and even the lowliest peasant tilling Taldan soil takes pride in the fact that she's Taldan. Millennia of tradition have taken their toll on the realm, however, and the empire now holds only a fraction of the lands it once controlled. An ongoing, intermittent war with the neighboring satrapy of Qadira has instilled an anti-Keleshite and anti-Sarenite prejudice among many Taldans, and the nation's longstanding policy of agnatic succession, limiting the lines of succession to male descendants, has led to an unfortunately sexist trend in politics and society as a whole. The nobility's focus on prestige and personal power has consumed a disproportionate share of attention and resources, leaving the lower classes in increasingly dire straits and allowing the empire's once-magnificent infrastructure to slowly crumble.",
						"A recent and hotly contested transition of power in Taldor has begun to overturn some of these trends. Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian is the first woman to rule Taldor in the empire's history, following the Taldan Senate's vote to overturn the longstanding policy of limiting the crown to male heirs. Though still relatively new to the throne, Eutropia has already proven herself a formidable monarch with her wise arbitration and cunning diplomacy, upholding the proud and rich Taldan culture while investing in the realm's long-neglected infrastructure. With the aid of her resurrected brother Prince Carrius\u2014who bears a strong spiritual connection to some of the greatest of Taldor's past emperors\u2014she's already managed to heal some of the divides caused by the bloody civil war that accompanied her rise to power, and by all accounts appears poised to revitalize Taldor as a nation. Yet the War for the Crown is still a fresh wound, and the old guard of Taldor has not yet fallen away. Many of Eutropia's former rivals remain in powerful positions and still oppose her rule, and plots and schemes circulate within every echelon of Taldan society.",
						"Taldor has long maintained an impressive military whose forces include the Taldan Horse, Taldan Phalanx, and Imperial Navy, but these assets have come to the fore with Tar-Baphon's move to claim Absalom\u2014itself not so far from Taldor's capital of Oppara. Nearly any Taldan can recount the nation's glorious leadership in the Shining Crusade and the victory the Taldan General Arnisant achieved there, and many in the nation view Tar-Baphon's return as an opportunity to once again shine on the field of glorious battle. Military outposts that not so long ago were devoted to skirmishes with Qadiran forces are now training troops for the potential return of the Whispering Tyrant, and the city of Cassomir has undergone a massive revival as the navy has begun building new ships at an unprecedented rate.",
						"Taldor as a whole maintains a close watch on neighboring lands. Some of this is handled through official channels, but a substantial portion of this work falls to the unseen hands of the secretive Lion Blades. Primarily recruited from Oppara's famous bardic colleges, Lion Blades specialize in infiltration, espionage, and even assassination to further their nation's goals. The Lion Blades' current leader is Dominicus Rell, who officially served as an advisor to the previous Grand Prince Stavian III and continues in that role for Eutropia, though rumor within the Lion Blades suggests a growing divide in agents' loyalty, with some favoring a senior agent named Laurisa Tromaine over Dominicus."

						"The largest woodland in Avistan straddles the borders of Andoran, Galt, and Taldor. Despite existing at the crux of several major powers, the resident druids, gnomes, and fey within the Verduran Forest maintain a large degree of autonomy from the surrounding lands.",
						"Taldor long ago came to terms with its woodland neighbors through the Treaty of the Wildwood, which established peaceful and mutually beneficial terms for logging and preservation alike. Residents of the Andoren portion of the forest, however, have found themselves in a growing conflict with loggers and the Lumber Consortium, especially as impending war has driven up demand for raw timber throughout the region. Only the efforts of the gnomes of Wispil, in accordance with the Treaty of the Wildwood, have prevented similar tensions with Taldor, whose shipbuilding has also increased demand on Verduran timber.",
						"Long isolationist, the Wildwood druids have nevertheless found new allies in recent years. Some of Kyonin's first overtures beyond their borders were to the Verduran Forest, given the two cultures' shared appreciation for natural lands. The elves provide the Wildwood Lodge with current information on the outside world\u2014an increasing necessity, as the forest's proximity to Absalom means it will have little chance to remain neutral in any conflict with the Whispering Tyrant. A growing number of Rivethun dwarves from the Five Kings Mountains have also begun traveling to the Verduran Forest for mentorship."
