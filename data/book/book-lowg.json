In its pages, you'll learn about the heart of the Pathfinder setting, known as the Inner Sea region, from the towns and cities your heroes call home to the wild frontiers and monstrous lairs where they'll risk everything in search of fortune and glory. The information presented here provides players with a sense of the setting as a whole and is perfect for both fleshing out existing character concepts and inspiring you when you're not sure what to play. Is your wizard a necromancer from haunted Ustalav, raised to battle the undead armies of the Whispering Tyrant, or a young student at the Arcanamirium in Absalom, the City at the Center of the World? Perhaps you're a daring priest from the burning deserts of Qadira, blasting manticores and genies with the blazing light of the sun goddess Sarenrae, or a troll-hunting warrior from the icy Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Regardless, here you'll find the rich details you need to give your character the perfect backstory, as well as new backgrounds, gods, feats, spells, and other rules to help you customize your ideal hero.",

Will you take your group to the rugged land of Numeria in search of alien technology from a crashed spaceship? Might they fight devils in diabolical Cheliax, or instead ally with the denizens of Hell themselves to reforge a troubled empire? They could venture into the ancient pyramids of Osirion, where mummies guard magic from a lost age, or battle dragons in the fractious orc hold of Belkzen. Whether you want your party to face pirates or giants, elves or dwarves, vampires or sphinxes, there's no end to the threats and treasures lurking in the ruins of lost empires, in temples to forgotten gods\u2014or just beyond their campfire's light.",

An indomitable companion increases its Constitution modifier by 2 and its Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom modifiers by 1. It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Increase its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert and its proficiency rank in barding to expert. It also learns the advanced maneuver for its type.
