						"Depending on who's describing them, the Firebrands are either loud, ostentatious daredevils with a penchant for bragging or secretive operatives looking to act in the best interests of the oppressed and needy. In truth, both are correct, and the Firebrands revel in the confusion this causes among the populace of the Inner Sea region.",
						"The group known as the Firebrands came about through an unofficial alliance between several like-minded organizations around 4716 ar. A revolution in Sargava had overthrown the colonialist government and formed a new country known as Vidrian\u2014but once the dust had settled, the fledgling nation found itself with few allies. Vidrian hurried to establish relationships with other nations, but its relatively remote location made this task difficult. As such, many Vidrics set out to sea. The ships headed south found allies among the anadi people of Nurvatchta, while the northbound ships found kinship among the rebels of Ravounel. Having just concluded their own rebellion against Cheliax, the people of Ravounel\u2014and specifically members of the rebel group known as the Silver Ravens\u2014brokered an alliance with the Vidrics. On the surface, this was a typical alliance in which Ravounel and Vidrian established diplomatic and trade relations. Beneath the surface, however, the two groups found a shared passion for combating oppression and helping those unable to defend themselves.",
						"The groups united under a shared banner known as the Firebrands and pooled their allies, expertise, and resources to work against tyranny where they could. The Vidrics made use of their sizable fleet of ships to ferry Firebrands to where they were needed, sometimes under the cover of diplomatic endeavors or disguised as pirates. Members of the Silver Ravens used their sizable network of allies, including their connections to the Bellflower Network, to help the Firebrands work in secret by moving between safe houses. Over time, smaller local organizations joined up with the Firebrands, and the group became a moderately sized network of freedom fighters who supported each other wherever possible.",
						"Several months after the Firebrands' establishment, a small uprising in Galt claimed to be associated with the Firebrands, though this was a blatant lie. Word of this claim reached the Firebrands, and the group quickly jumped to offer what support they could. Though the uprising failed shortly thereafter, word of the Firebrands' attempts to help reached others. Soon others attempting rebellion claimed to be Firebrands, attracting support from the actual organization. Purporting to be a Firebrand quickly became the easiest way to become a Firebrand proper, as the rebels acknowledge all who adopt the title and work toward the group's goals.",
						"This impromptu convention eventually began to spread among outside groups with indirect ties to the Firebrands. At first, several Shackles pirates, originally hired to serve 67 as Firebrand transports, began to claim their association with the group. The pirates found the idea of sowing discord and generally causing problems for established power structures to be an entertaining undertaking. Their mischief drew a great deal of attention from other pirates and daredevils, and their efforts led to the name and deeds of the Firebrands becoming more commonly known among the general populace of the Inner Sea. However, instead of considering them liberators and helpers of the downtrodden, the common folk became enamored of tales about Firebrands who were exhibitionist adventurers with a fondness for bombast and excitement. The original Firebrands initially worked to disassociate themselves from these thrill seekers, but they soon realized keeping public attention on the daredevils made their rebellious endeavors significantly easier.",
						"Today, the Firebrands are broken up into two unofficial factions. The first consists of those who continue to use the group's connections and resources to help those in need. They travel the world helping to fight tyrants, assisting refugees, and providing aid to innocents. The other faction is the organization's public face. They are the show-offs and thrill seekers, choosing to fly the flag of the Firebrands because it encourages the extravagant and the flamboyant. There are many Firebrands who straddle the line between the two groups\u2014some choose to fight oppression for the thrills of combat and defying authority, while others enjoy the praise and hero-worship that comes with saving the downtrodden. Still others prefer to use the attention they garner from their work to inspire others to do the same, hoping to act as icons of revolution and welfare throughout the world.",
						"The liberators and do-gooders of the Firebrands continue the group's original traditions. They travel throughout the Inner Sea region\u2014and sometimes out into the rest of Golarion\u2014to fight oppression wherever and whenever possible. They assist and defend those who are unable to fight for themselves. The Firebrands also work to help areas recover and rebuild from the destruction that can occur during revolution. This includes helping farmers reestablish farmlands, working to educate locals until proper schools are rebuilt, and providing food and entertainment for those recovering from wounds or afflictions.",
						"The rest of the Firebrands travel the Inner Sea region, regaling all who listen with tales of their own deeds and accomplishments. These Firebrands often dress in flashy, fashionable outfits and tend to bring sizable entourages with them on their journeys. Such Firebrands commonly boast before heading out on adventures, hoping to garner further attention with claims of being able to complete a quest with only a single hand or while blindfolded. Not all Firebrands choose to draw such attention to themselves, however; some instead strive to perform glorious deeds, letting their successful exploits speak for themselves and leaving calling cards to let others know who was responsible for their extraordinary feats.",

								"{@b Local Authorities:} Many Firebrands tend to be a frequent nuisance and cause collateral damage in their wake, making them a headache for most authorities. In many cases, the Firebrands actively work against laws they feel are oppressive (and depending on the Firebrand, that distinction can vary greatly), with Firebrands either working with locals to overthrow their oppressors or taking action alone if necessary.

								"Enrollment in the Firebrands is a curious thing, as there is no official structure to the organization. Instead, an individual's standing among the Firebrands is based mostly around their reputation both inside and outside the group. Those with more renown and daring deeds to their name are considered to have higher ranking among their fellow Firebrands.",
								"While there are no official titles among the Firebrands, every member is categorized in the context of four different rankings, known as marks, a system derived from the Firebrand symbol of two crossed swords. The first use of this symbol originated among Vidric rebels who rose up to reclaim their lands; the rebels used the swords featured on the Sargavan flag as a means of communication, drawing or painting the blades on structures to signify safe houses or hidden caches. The simplicity of the symbol\u2014two large marks for the sword blades and two smaller marks for the cross guard\u2014made it easy for Vidrics to leave a message with short notice. Vidrics continued to use this mark until it became the official symbol of the Firebrands. Today, the symbol is used wherever the Firebrands wish to make their presence known, though individual marks vary. Firebrands place specific symbols beneath the crossed blades, such as a silver raven or a specific ship's flag, to further signify exactly who made the mark and which local group claims responsibility for a particular act.",
								"Anyone can declare themselves as a member of the Firebrands, though status as a member is not considered official until a potential recruit gains a significant amount of notoriety. This usually requires several dozen locals in an area, typically 50, or a handful of local Firebrands to become aware of the prospective member. The process is often relatively quick, as most wishing to join can make a public declaration, usually in a loud and showy manner. Once this is done, the prospective member earns the title of first mark. The ease of becoming a first mark means that first marks come and go constantly, and most Firebrands do not consider a first mark truly official until a member reaches the rank of second mark.",
								"To reach the status of second mark, a Firebrand of second mark or higher must make a declaration that the first mark is an official Firebrand. This declaration can be made in public, as with the initial claim of membership, or in private among other Firebrands. Regardless of the publicity, the declaration is capped with the Firebrand and the first mark crossing blades. In cases where no blades are available, the two cross any weapon at hand, or even cross arms when no weapons are available. This symbolic recreation of the Firebrand symbol allows the second mark access to the resources of the local Firebrands, such as armaments, contacts, equipment, safe houses, or training.",
								"Third marks are simply second marks who have gained local fame. Sometimes these are individuals known by name or an alias. Other times, an entire group can become a third mark due to the group's notoriety in its home region. In this case, anyone that is a member of said group is a third mark, regardless of their standing or seniority within the group itself. Firebrands don't designate the third mark ranking based on any internal parameters, instead recognizing the ranking when the common populace is aware of the members; once a Firebrand or group of Firebrands becomes well known, whether due to popularity or infamy, they are third marks regardless of what other Firebrands may think of it. Most Firebrands acknowledge that it's hard to determine exactly when this happens, but it becomes obvious once locals start expressing outward opinions of a Firebrand.",
								"The title of fourth mark is even more nebulous than that of third mark. Fourth marks are those Firebrands that almost everyone knows. These can be individuals whose names travel in stories across Golarion, like Devrin Arlos or the Sapphire Butterfly. Others are groups like the Silver Ravens that achieved great recognition due to their deeds and thus all members, new and old, are considered fourth marks. Much like the ranking of third mark, there's no official threshold for a fourth mark\u2014only a nebulous consensus once fellow Firebrands or distant locals begin to share stories about the deeds of a particular individual or a certain group. Many Firebrands like to debate about specific individuals or groups to determine whether or not they are worthy of becoming fourth marks. Even with the constant debates, Firebrands universally recognize certain key members as fourth marks, usually those in leadership roles.",
								"While it's easy for anyone to begin their journey as a member of the Firebrands, the nature of the organization helps to sniff out those who are attempting to infiltrate the group. First off, anyone who has heard of the Firebrands knows the group does not intentionally harm innocents. The Firebrands typically squabble with local authorities, oppressive groups, or, in some cases, with each other, and while collateral damage to innocents is always a possibility, anyone who sets out specifically to harm innocents in the name of the Firebrands is quickly dismissed. These people never become second marks and likely draw the ire of proper Firebrands. In addition, individual Firebrands constantly work to maintain their local networks. Often, this manifests as secret codes and signals among rebels that change at regular intervals. Individuals who might bring harm to the Firebrands do not receive these updates, and soon find themselves marked as obvious outcasts. For Firebrands without such systems in place, the local populace still acts as the Firebrands' eyes and ears. Allies of the Firebrands report any issues or concerns they have with other members, allowing the larger body of Firebrands to respond accordingly.",

										"Though the Firebrands are a relatively young organization, especially compared to other prominent organizations like the Pathfinder Society, the group's popularity has grown quickly in the years since its formation. Once the first rumors of Firebrands supporting local rebellions started to spread, pockets of resistance throughout Avistan began to call out to the Firebrands. These groups placed the Firebrand's crossed-blade symbol wherever they could, and soon enough other rebels rallied to their cause. In some of these cases, such as with the ongoing resistance in Pezzack, Firebrands made the trek to offer their support. At other times, the locals inspired themselves with their actions and gathered enough local support that they became their own local group of Firebrands. This was the case with the small kingdom of Crossroads in the southern River Kingdoms, where the locals rose up against a local group of marauders that constantly threatened the fledgling kingdom's livelihood.",
										"Once the more boisterous side of the Firebrands came to the forefront, the group's notoriety increased quickly. Many found the Firebrands' behavior entertaining, while others were awestruck by the tales of great heroics or perilous acts from which a Firebrand escapes unscathed. Traveling Firebrands soon found themselves overwhelmed with bored homemakers and excited locals insisting on hearing tales of the latest Firebrand exploits. Sometimes these tales were recountings of thrilling exploits, while others are merely exhilarating lies. Regardless of their validity, such tales only boosted the exciting Firebrand way of life, soon making the Firebrands something of a household name.",
										"Today, Firebrands continue to uphold their traditions all over the Inner Sea region, with many finding their ways to large port cities like Absalom, Almas, and Magnimar. These cities provide numerous eyes for those seeking attention, and plenty of crowds for those looking to disappear. The cities also allow any would-be Firebrands to hop on to a ship and join up with a Firebrand crew with relative ease. Many of these crews set off upon the high seas in search of adventure and treasure in places like the Shackles or even beyond the Inner Sea. Some smaller towns also harbor a Firebrand presence, though how easy it is to identify such groups varies from one town to the next."

When the first grandstanders began gaining attention, they were quick to realize that it would require greater and greater exploits to attract notice while other Firebrands were engaging in their own astonishing ventures. To attract the gaze of onlookers and draw more attention to their own deeds, some Firebrands began sporting elaborate outfits with eye-catching colors and ostentatious accessories.",
										"Firebrand fashion has begun to take hold in places like Absalom and Andoran, with many younger nobles and local adventurers taking to gaudy clothing, bright feathers, excessive amounts of jewelry, and large hats to emulate the styles of notable Firebrands. Since this flare in popular fashion, Firebrands and fashionistas all over have tweaked and reworked this original fashion trend to suit their own tastes.",
										"Current Firebrand fashion varies greatly from region to region, but those seeking attention make the most of what's available to them. Some Firebrands take local fashions and alter them to be outrageously showy and glamorous. Other Firebrands create entire outfits from scratch, allowing them to express their creative sides. Some of these outfits are marvels all their own, mimicking great birds or incorporating wearable contraptions that can independently wave flags or even play music.",
										"Local Firebrand groups tend to adopt their own particular fashion trends and colors, with certain groups coordinating clothing across their membership. Such Firebrands sometimes even modify their symbols with specific colors, which helps to differentiate such groups in places where multiple Firebrand-affiliated organizations are active.",
										"Firebrands who prefer subtlety instead choose simpler clothing that allows them to slip in and out of crowds unnoticed. In situations where anonymity is important, these Firebrands wear masks or other disguises that make identification difficult."

In any case, the screams of unsuccessful evil Hellknight hopefuls echo just as loudly throughout a citadel's halls as do those of the weak and the wanting\u2014and the pits of Hell are happy to welcome all failures into the eternal embrace of the damned."

								"Although each Hellknight order's unique lore and history are largely opaque to the masses, the general process for becoming a Hellknight is practically common knowledge. Hellknight hopefuls must petition to join an order at that group's citadel or through the patronage of a serving Hellknight. At this point, a recruit becomes classified as an armiger, and they undergo intensive reeducation and physical training with a member of their chosen order to move forward with their candidacy for knighthood. In some cases, a Hellknight might train their own armiger in the field. Armigers typically train for as long as an overseeing Hellknight believes necessary, though the typical period is about 3 years.",
								"At any point in an armiger's training\u2014but typically at the behest of a sponsoring or overseeing Hellknight\u2014 the armiger may request to take the Hellknight Test. If the candidate passes the test, the armiger becomes a full Hellknight, receives their official armor and weapon of their order, and is invested with all the authority and station their rank confers. If the armiger fails the test, they die, and the order does not mourn them.",
								"The Hellknight Test is simple: an armiger must best an immortal champion of Hell whose power in combat mirrors her own. The test's specifics differ subtly between orders, but for all of them, the official test is a somber ritual conducted twice each year. A high-ranking officer oversees the test, a signifer administers it in conjuring the devil, and every available member of the order stands witness.",
								"After a lengthy introduction, the armiger in question enters a clearly marked arena. The signifer then conjures the devil, and the two fight to the death. If the armiger prevails, they recite their vows immediately after the battle, as long as their injuries aren't life threatening. If the armiger dies, the test is over and they fail.",
								"By decree of the Measure, there is one alternate way to achieve knighthood. An armiger can defeat a qualifying devil in single combat outside of the ritual ceremony, but doing so requires a sponsor. If a Hellknight in good standing bears witness to the feat and vouches for them, the armiger can become a member of the order.",

					"entries": [
						"Among the first atrocities perpetrated by the Whispering Tyrant after his emergence from his prison-fortress in 4719 ar was the transformation of the guardian nation of Lastwall into the desolate, undead-haunted waste known as the Gravelands. While the vast majority of the nation's cities and soldiers were wiped out in that grim event, a fraction of Lastwall's knights survived and helped the remaining citizens of Lastwall escape. From among those battered crusaders and ragtag refugees rose a new knightly order: the first rays of dawn upon the horizon, the first flickers of a new Shining Crusade\u2014the Knights of Lastwall.",
						"While the knights place the Whispering Tyrant's destruction, Lastwall's reclamation, and the defeat of undead and necromancers above other goals, they also seek to keep the spirit of Lastwall alive through their deeds. The order's members are typically paragons of good in all forms, from justice and heroism to charity and redemption. Even the most driven knights reject the notion of descending into evil to fight evil; while they may temporarily ally with evil creatures in times of need, a typical knight never allows themself to become tarnished by such associations or permits evil to occur on their watch.",
						"The knights have no true headquarters or official leaders; their belief in centralized leadership died with Vigil, and the knights now seek to build consensus rather than follow authority, though senior or especially accomplished members garner influence and respect among their fellows. Members are encouraged to consider themselves first among equals, as anyone who is willing to lay down their life against the hordes of the Whispering Tyrant should be considered worthy. If a knight should stray from the proper path, a trio of knights seeks out the wayward member to investigate matters and, if necessary, aid their comrade's rehabilitation. When members of the order gather in numbers, they most often travel in military fashion, packing light and establishing temporary camps. In cases where centralized command is required, such as large-scale battle, particularly inspiring or tactically minded knights are elected to serve as commanders for the conflict's duration.",
						"While the Knights of Lastwall are not officially a religious organization, the nature of their goals attracts many people of faith. Followers of all the major gods of good can be found among the order, from Erastilian rangers to Iomedaean paladins or Shelynite bards, and devotees of the empyreal lord Ragathiel are particularly common. Followers of most neutral deities are largely welcome as well, so long as their hearts are good\u2014with some exceptions. Worshippers of Abadar, for example, have faced some resistance from other knights; while Abadarans consider it their duty to bring order to Lastwall and contain the undead crisis, many knights fear unscrupulous members of Abadar's clergy may attempt to profit off the devastation.",
						"There are two major subfactions among the Knights of Lastwall. The Shining Sentinels are crusaders and defenders at heart, striving to keep the plague of undeath from spreading, protecting innocents from evil, and shielding the weak from the depredations of the strong. They are the most concerned with keeping the legends, heroes, and spirit of Lastwall alive, seeing themselves as the heirs of Lastwall's cause and serving as a living memorial to all of the previous heroes who sacrificed their lives. They currently seek to rally the nations of Avistan to a second Shining Crusade against the Whispering Tyrant. Shining Sentinels are primarily based in the city of Vellumis on the shores of Lake Encarthan, but they pursue their crusade across all of Avistan. Understanding that the might of entire nations will be required to defeat Tar-Baphon, sentinels travel to noble courts to persuade rulers to lend aid or promise future support to the fledgling crusade, or to town squares and city streets to recruit idealistic youths and local heroes. Some sentinels travel in search of wrongs to right or innocent folk to defend, or to conduct righteous personal quests and strengthen themselves for the conflict to come; such knights might find themselves drawn into parties of goodhearted adventurers, where they protect their comrades with all of their skill. In battle, sentinels favor defensive tactics such as shield walls or choke points, prioritizing the survival and protection of innocents.",
						"Conversely, the Crimson Reclaimers seek to take the fight to their foe directly. While they cooperate with the Shining Sentinels, it is an open secret that reclaimers are more disillusioned and jaded than their fellows\u2014 most feel some measure of betrayal by the failures of their leadership in the days leading up to Lastwall's destruction, and they are skeptical of Shining Sentinel idealism. Still heroes at heart, the majority of reclaimers occupy the Gravelands, harrying the Tyrant's forces and undermining his plots while protecting those refugees that remain. Though these efforts seem doomed to fail, many reclaimers are skilled veterans who are no strangers to putting their life on the line for the cause. They are also bolstered and protected by a mysterious rite known as the Crimson Oath, first sworn by Clarethe Iomedar, the so-called Sunset Angel. Most Crimson Reclaimers swear this oath upon joining, and it grants them some measure of power against the constant horrors of the Gravelands. Among the order, only a few know the true nature of the oath, though rumors abound among the ranks that the rite is connected to a powerful and hidden patron whom many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of Ragathiel. While some Reclaimers find this secrecy disquieting, Clarethe's charisma, heroism, leadership, and devotion to the cause are enough to quell most concerns.",

								"It takes a truly exceptional personality to stand up and carry on in the face of utter defeat. What causes some individuals to be viewed with admiration in the face of failure when so many others in the same position are treated with contempt is a mystery for the ages, but one thing has proven true for the former Watcher-Lord of Lastwall, Ulthun II\u2014the rich, powerful, and noble all love a displaced royal. Though his nation was lost and he was forced to retreat, Ulthun and his retinue arrived to a hero's welcome in Absalom. Some of this was due to the recent siege that Absalom faced from Tar-Baphon's forces, which engendered a natural empathy toward those who had fared worse against the Whispering Tyrant; some was due to the quick and natural friendship Ulthun found with Acting Primarch Wynsal Starborn, due to their common military background. But much of it seems due to pure fancy, as people became wrapped up in half-true tales of gallant heroism and a rightful heir to a lost throne.",
								"Neither Ulthun nor most of the Shining Sentinels that still look to him are entirely happy with their newfound celebrity, as the fall of Lastwall seems far too bleak an affair to inspire such curiosity and gossip. At the same time, it has placed Ulthun and his closest retinue in a far more valuable position than any they could find on the battlefield. Inspired bankers, nobles, and youths mean a steady stream of money, supplies, and fresh recruits to those nations threatened by the Whispering Tyrant's undead armies, and those supplies mean the difference between life and death for the Knights of Lastwall. That Ulthun remains in Absalom while others die in horrific battles means that at times he feels like a fraud and a coward, though he knows his efforts to inspire others in the war effort are just as crucial to defeating the Whispering Tyrant as individual sacrifices.",
								"To this end, the Shining Sentinels set up an embassy to their ruined nation in Absalom's Precipice Quarter, an area of the city that likewise fell to ruin and has been abandoned ever since. Acting on the suggestion of Wynsal Starborn and feeling some kinship with the shattered district, Ulthun has made it his goal to lead by example, by both attracting people to his cause and providing a much-needed service to the community. Following in the watcher-lord's footsteps, most of the Shining Sentinels seek out similar causes in the towns and nations they visit, helping out wherever they can\u2014and perhaps proving that the world can be made a better place.",
								"Ulthun's trials have also had a curious impact on some other residents of the Inner Sea region: goblins. When the watcher-lord limped into Absalom with the remainder of his shattered forces, he brought a very unexpected aide-de-camp\u2014a goblin named Zusgut\u2014along with an entire goblin tribe. Though the city watch was skeptical, Ulthun swore by his companions and made it clear they had been critical to his escape. As a result, the goblins became something of celebrities themselves, if viewed with a tinge of apprehension as the citizens adjusted to their presence. Some of this acceptance was simply by fortune of geography, since Absalom proper has had less trouble in the past with goblins than other locales, but whatever the reason, the end result was that goblins are treated better in the city than in most parts of the Inner Sea region."

Most knights who swear the Crimson Oath instinctively feel that this figure is more grim than Ulthun II or other shining heroes of Lastwall, yet intrigued by the Crimson Reclaimers: the entity has shown support for those who are wounded by their experiences but who still maintain their will to fight the good fight. It is this tenacity that attracts many of the Crimson Reclaimers\u2014while many knights have been robbed of their innocence and can no longer put their faith in heroic tales that too often prove to be cruel lies, they are still willing to stand up and fight to ensure no one else has to suffer the same indignities. To have a benefactor who accepts the Crimson Reclaimers in all their broken glory and perhaps understands them in a way that none of their more idealistic companions can is a boon none of the Crimson Reclaimers treat lightly.",
								"Much as Ulthun's goblin aides have raised questions, the anonymous benefactor of the Crimson Reclaimers has spurred no shortage of controversy. Rumors persist of undead hiding among the Crimson Reclaimer's ranks, concealed from detection by an unknown power\u2014 supposedly those who suffered unwilling transformation into undeath at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant and his forces. And while none of the knights have proof or can name any examples, rumors continue to circulate of undead monsters that were given means to maintain their personality or were freed from their servitude by the Crimson Oath. Much like all things related to the Crimson Reclaimers, this rumor has led to a clash of viewpoints; some consider this purported power to be a gift of ultimate mercy, while others hold concerns that such an incredible boon could only spring from potent necromantic magic."

						"Founded by Old-Mage Jatembe and his Ten Magic Warriors during the Age of Anguish, the Magaambya academy has been a beacon of learning and order for over 8,000 years. The academy lies in Nantambu in the western Mwangi Expanse, near the Buunta Flow southwest of Lake Ocota, and the contemporary Magaambya furthers Jatembe's legacy far beyond Mwangi communities. Recent developments have drawn members primarily into Avistan, but they attain and spread knowledge, further diplomatic relations, and promote safety throughout Golarion.",
						"The Magaambya teaches an inclusive approach that touches all of its endeavors. This is most evident in Nantambu, where education spills from the colorful, mosaicked terraces of the academy's towers and into the streets. The academy houses an impressive collection of documents and its fair share of high-ceilinged lecture halls, but Magaambyans hold that the most important knowledge is learned within a community. Students are often found discussing the finer points of magic while maintaining Nantambu's canals or helping a farmer pick crops. They learn diplomacy through negotiations that have bound Nantambu to other Mwangi communities for millennia. To a Magaambyan, the world is a classroom, and while they much prefer a pragmatic path that betters one's community, they know multiple paths lead to the attainment of knowledge.",
						"The same holds true for magic, where the Magaambya's tradition of inclusivity becomes true syncretism. Old-Mage Jatembe saw the convergence of all magic, regardless of the traditions they were based in. This confluence between the different mystic essences became the keystone of halcyon magic, the Magaambyan blending of the primal and the arcane. The Magaambyans built on their founder's work to further magical techniques, and as such have always been at the forefront of magical theory and application.",
						"However, putting this Magaambyan philosophy into practice has its challenges. Combining different essences of magic takes great effort and long study, as does equitable diplomacy. The Magaambya's students value building a consensus and finding compromise, and Magaambyans are careful to give every participant in a negotiation a voice. They also ensure their acquisition of cultural knowledge neither erases nor erodes the culture from which it is drawn. Conscientious work is time consuming and difficult, but millennia of Magaambyan prominence speak to its value.",
						"The Magaambya focuses learning into five specialized faculties, known as branches. While most Magaambyan endeavors are collaborative affairs with at least one member from each branch, members of individual branches tend to have similar areas of expertise.",
						"Members of the academically focused Cascade Bearers are dedicated to the advancement of magical theory. Their philosophical approach to magic reaches into other magical traditions but still has a practical bent.",
						"Although outsiders classify the Emerald Boughs as spies, Magaambyans adamantly oppose this categorization. Instead, they view the intelligence-gathering branch as a bulwark against crisis. Members live within communities to learn cultural practices and identify the potential needs of residents. They don't generally seek to influence local events to the Magaambya's benefit; rather, they genuinely wish to improve the communities in which they are embedded.",
						"Rain-Scribes explore new territory and make sure it remains accessible for future travelers. They chart and manage wilderness areas, establish and maintain infrastructure, and guide travelers. They are also keenly aware of balance, both natural and societal.",
						"Tempest-Sun Mages defend the Magaambya's holdings, members, and allies. More wardens than warriors, Tempest-Sun Mages end conflict using spell and speech.",
						"Members of the Uzunjati, the oldest branch the Magaambya, are maintainers of peace and the guardians of thousands of storytelling traditions. Their name is an ancient Mwangi word for a story or collection of knowledge. Uzunjati weave captivating tales, drawing out lessons they apply to their diplomacy.",
						"Magaambyans' focus on knowledge and safety drew them to Avistan, where recent events have had potentially global effects. In the Gravelands, the fire-blackened city of Vellumis now houses a significant Magaambyan presence. Magaambyans join the Knights of Lastwall in defensive actions to safeguard patrols, as well as research forays into the Gravelands. The Thassilonians' reemergence brings both ancient knowledge and new nations to Varisia. The Magaambya is uncertain of Sorshen's purported benevolence and has sent an Emerald Bough\u2013led complement to the Eurythnian port of Brinewall. These adepts keep a cautious finger on the pulse of Thassilonian acclimation to contemporary Avistan. Cascade Bearers and Rain-Scribes lead efforts in the Sarkoris Scar, where they help disperse demons and investigate material effects of the enormous extraplanar forces released by the Worldwound's closing.",
						"Engaging stories, magical acumen, and altruism hold an attraction for potential members, and the prestige of the school draws in many prospective students, especially from the Mwangi Expanse. The Magaambya also appeals to those preferring a self-directed, less regimented education. A would-be student often notices a Magaambyan's distinctive brooch\u2014the Magaambya's insignia, often with animal motifs, and sometimes colored to denote branch affiliation\u2014and inquires about membership. Such individuals need only gain the respect of a Magaambyan for a potential sponsorship and admittance. Once admitted, members freely share the Magaambya's resources with one another, such as magical tomes, cultural records, and documents they have safeguarded since the dawn of post-Earthfall human civilization.",

								"The Magaambya accepts anyone who can prove their good intentions and has earned the trust of a Magaambyan. While not overly hierarchical, the Magaambya divides membership into ranks based on proven knowledge and aptitude: initiate, attendant, conversant, lore-speaker, and learned one. Magaambyan advancement bears little resemblance to Taldan or other Avistani academic careers. Lectures in the traditional sense are infrequent, and students instead learn through a kind of apprenticeship with a variety of higher-ranking members. The first such apprenticeship is the Perquisite, a period of public service. Students traditionally complete the Perquisite in the academy itself in Nantambu, but as the Magaambya expands, its members can be found completing their Perquisites in myriad places. Regardless of location, learning how to meet a community's needs is the first and most important lesson.",
								"Initiates are those in the process of fulfilling the Perquisite. The Magaambya believes that diverse backgrounds mean a stronger community, so anyone can apply for initiation. Magaambyans actively interested in recruiting new students also traverse the Mwangi Expanse, seeking out those with an interest in magic and bringing them to the city of Nantambu\u2014in many nearby villages, sending children to the Magaambya for study is an entrenched tradition. Hopefuls petition an existing Magaambyan sponsor, and if an applicant seems a good fit, a conversant then conducts a more complete interview, ideally with testimony from an applicant's colleagues or family. A successful interview can lead to acceptance, which includes a token of the conversant's approval so that it's known who granted the initiate membership. Initiates engage in manual labor, academic assistance, or other day-to-day tasks typical in their host communities (even high-ranking members will participate in these tasks on occasion, knowing that this work keeps them grounded). In exchange, the initiates are permitted to attend organized lectures, access the Magaambya's libraries, and receive advice. This practice fosters community and enables the incidental learning that comes from cooperation.",
								"Attendants are initiates who have fulfilled the Perquisite and proven their worth to their peers, who refer them to a higher-ranking Magaambyan for advancement. The Perquisite traditionally lasts five seasons, though Magaambyans outside Nantambu have begun expediting the process based on the capabilities of the initiate, among other factors. Attendants' responsibilities involve organizing work efforts, aiding in logistics of field studies, and arranging classes. For the latter, attendants are expected to recognize an educational need and arrange for its fulfillment; regularly scheduled classes are uncommon. Attendants may accompany field studies or receive mentorship from higher-ranking members. Attendants are also traditionally the first rank to begin study of syncretic halcyon techniques. Finally, to direct their future development, attendants establish an affiliation with one of the five branches.",
								"Conversants have accumulated enough practical, cultural, and academic knowledge to be a self-directed boon to the Magaambya. Magical talent is not required to achieve this rank\u2014the Magaambya takes a broad view of education and capability\u2014but many of its members have magical aptitude. Conversants direct special projects and arrange field operations, both furthering their own training and mentoring lower-ranked members. With their freedom to self-direct, conversants are the first rank to engage in the proud Magaambyan tradition of making prospective mentees track them down in the field\u2014the journey, conversants say, is just as capable a teacher.",
								"Lore-speakers demonstrate mastery of Magaambyan techniques. This includes magic\u2014so far, only spellcasters have been granted the rank of lore-speaker. They are leaders in their communities whose magical acumen, practical skill, and broad knowledge mean they can capably address a variety of potential problems. They oversee Magaambyan efforts in a region or direct courses of study. Most work towards broad-reaching goals, such as brokering alliances, establishing transportation routes, or pursuing major magical theorems.",
								"Learned ones are the heads of the five branches. They volunteer for their positions, but a prospective candidate is elevated to the position only with the other learned ones' approval and that of a majority of Magaambyans. Learned ones are thoughtful and powerful individuals who recognize the importance of their positions.",

										"Once a Magaambyan student reaches the rank of attendant, they are granted the right to wear a personal mask that is acknowledged by the teachers and other students at the academy. This mask is an abstract representation of the outward magic that the attendant chooses to focus on, the internal magic that is an intrinsic part of the attendant, and the attendant's true spiritual face, symbolizing the blending of all four essences of magic. These masks almost always take the form of animals, as the true form of these concepts is both impossible to depict in the material world and too personal to share with others.",
										"The mask begins as a mere construction of wood and paint, carved into the shape of an animal the attendant feels a powerful connection to; while some students choose more prestigious animals over those of personal importance, this often results in the mask's magic becoming unruly and acting out in undesirable ways. The mask serves as a focus for the attendant's magic by bridging the physical and spiritual realms, causing the mask to gain a life and mind of its own. As the attendant continues to grow, their spirit leaves more and more of an imprint on the mask, until the mask houses the attendant's true magical self. Once this occurs, the bond between mask and attendant cannot be severed unless the mask is destroyed, freeing the attendant's spiritual face to be released back into the attendant's body. A side effect of this process is that the Magaambyan's spiritual self, usually limited to appearing only in otherworldly dreams or visions, is granted far more power over the world\u2014and over the Magaambyan themselves. Although the attendant can control the mask, the mask can also exert its influence over the attendant or even manifest as a familiar (see the {@feat Mask Familiar|locg} feat). This can sometimes seem jarring to those who witness it for the first time, as the odd personality contained within can seem like a completely different person than the attendant, but to the Magaambyans, the mask is simply another facet of the student.",
										"Not every Magaambyan chooses to wear a mask; some prefer to contact their spiritual selves the old-fashioned way, while others feel uncomfortable allowing something so personal to be seen by others, even in an abstract form. Others, such as the Magaambya's magic warriors, subsume their whole identity into the mask, disguising every other aspect of themselves."

You don't gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.",
										"Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can't heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can't select a halcyon spell as a signature spell.",
										"Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer's spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely."

						"The exploits of heroes have long stirred the hearts and inspired the souls of common folk the world over. But the daring adventurers of the Pathfinder Society live the deeds recounted in tales, and they share their awe-inspiring discoveries with the world at large in a series of volumes called the {@i Pathfinder Chronicles}. Their stories tell of fallen empires, wondrous magic, and mysterious creatures thought lost to time or never before chronicled by the people of the Inner Sea region.",
						"The Pathfinder Society was founded roughly four hundred years ago as the base of operations for a looseknit group of adventurers, from which they could publish their tales. Since its establishment, the Pathfinder Society has grown in prestige and influence not only across the Inner Sea region but around all of Golarion. The Society's agents have had a hand in countless events, ranging from small-scale tomb exploration to world-spanning conflicts with malevolent powers\u2014sometimes ones unearthed by the Society's own exploits. Whatever the outcome of their adventures, it is the agents' duty to report their discoveries to one of many lodges now scattered across Golarion, adding to the tales immortalized in the {@i Pathfinder Chronicles} and ensuring that their stories live on through the ages.",
						"Individual agents' reasons for joining the Society are as diverse as the agents themselves: some seek knowledge for its own sake; some seek glory, riches, or both; others are thrill-seekers and daredevils; and some serve the needs of one of the society's ever-evolving factions. While some agents are recruited outside of traditional channels, most prospective members travel to the Society's Grand Lodge in Absalom, where they undergo intensive tests and training. Three deans, called the Masters of Scrolls, Spells, and Swords, oversee this training process. The Scrolls train recruits in history, knowledge, and observation; the Spells provide training in lore and theory related to magic spells, creatures, places, and objects; and the Swords ensure recruits learn combat techniques and survival.",
						"Many Pathfinders favor one aspect of their training more than the others, but they must gain the approval of all three deans to become a full-fledged agent. Once approved, a Pathfinder initiate undergoes an individually tailored test called the Confirmation. In many ways, this test acts as the initiate's first mission as a Pathfinder, and afterward the initiate becomes a field agent\u2014a true Pathfinder, with equal status to all other agents.",
						"There is no official membership in the Society's three branches, but agents often continue to associate with their peers from the Scrolls, Spells, and Swords, and undertake missions that favor the goals of a particular branch.",
						"Those who identify with the Scrolls often stay within the safe confines of the lodges as they peruse dusty tomes and catalog discoveries. This lifestyle sometimes prompts derision from other Pathfinders, but those within the Scrolls maintain that their time in lodges and libraries is well spent. After all, Golarion's glorious past can't be witnessed firsthand\u2014usually, it can be discovered and relived only through the study of ancient texts. Nevertheless, many such agents also travel Golarion alongside other Pathfinders to achieve fame by chronicling Golarion's mysteries, searching for wealth, or conducting field research.",
						"In the course of their missions, Pathfinders often encounter strange magic, whether in the form of magical creatures, enchanted items, cursed places, or actual spells. Followers of the Spells excel on such missions, using their knowledge of magic to bypass dangers, protect their companions, or defeat their enemies. Though the agents who most commonly associate with this group are those who study and prepare spells, some are not spellcasters at all. Many wish to study magic for its own sake or in order to overcome magical threats.",
						"The Pathfinder Society relies on those who favor the Swords to support the more scholarly branches. These agents have a simple, if dangerous, directive: keep their fellow Pathfinders alive. Going well beyond simple combat skills, students of the Swords train to survive the unique threats of Golarion's many ancient places, such as traps, obscure hazards, and desolate environments scoured by magic. The philosophy of the Swords isn't about fighting fairly; survival is first and foremost. While those who identify with the Swords often leave academic affairs to other Pathfinders, that isn't always the case, and Swords can enjoy the thrill of discovery as much as any other agent.",
						"The Decemvirate\u2014a group of masked leaders often called \"The Ten\" by other Pathfinders\u2014oversees the overall goals and trajectory of the Pathfinder Society, but it leaves the operation of the local lodges and the details of organizing expeditions in the hands of veteran Pathfinders called venture-captains. Venture-captains have full authority over Society operations within their assigned region, often a nation or a portion thereof. The best-known venture-captain is Ambrus Valsin, who runs the Pathfinder's Grand Lodge in Absalom.",
						"Although the Pathfinder Society allows members with all manner of motivations, methodologies, and allegiances, each must abide by a general code of behavior. They all are expected to undertake missions of exploration and discovery, report their findings, and cooperate with other Pathfinders despite their differences. Venture-captains typically handle any breach of this code at the local level, but particularly egregious conduct violations\u2014such as attempting to steal or conceal a major discovery from the Society, or directly harming another Pathfinder\u2014might go all the way to the Decemvirate, who handle serious offenses in an efficient and impartial manner.",

								"The overwhelming majority of Pathfinders are field operatives. These agents come from all walks of life, but all of them share a drive for adventure and exploration. Most initiates undergo about 3 years of training at the Grand Lodge in Absalom before they become Pathfinder agents in their own right. Field agents live dangerously, but those who survive numerous missions eventually attain the rank of Seeker. While Seekers are technically peers of other Pathfinders, they command greater status and respect thanks to their history of service to the Society.",
								"The Pathfinder Society's global scope requires dozens of local leaders to run its operations. These venture-captains maintain lodges where agents can rest, resupply, conduct research, and embark on missions. The venturecaptains are many and varied, and word travels quickly between them; an agent who sours a relationship with one venture-captain, or particularly impresses them, may find that their reputation precedes them to other lodges. Venture-captains maintain relations with local governments as best they can, and these local allegiances can lend the Society extraordinary influence, but there are many places where the Society has done more harm than good. In these areas, and those far from a Pathfinder Society lodge, agents must act with greater discretion.",
								"Most agents ally themselves with one of several prominent factions within the Society. These factions vary broadly in their ideologies and methods, but all of them work\u2014for the most part\u2014to further the Society's goals. Faction leaders direct agents to undertake missions in pursuit of that faction's goals. Their interests occasionally place these factions at odds with one another, though outright opposition is increasingly rare. Over the years, new factions arise and old ones fade into obscurity, typically in conjunction with major events.",
								"While the faction leaders are influential, the people with the greatest power in the Society are an enigmatic group known as the Decemvirate. Nine members of \"The Ten\" conceal their identities with the aid of Decemvirate helms, magical artifacts that\u2014if the stories are to be believed\u2014Pathfinder agents discovered in ancient Azlant. The final member, Eliza Petulengro, revealed her identity following the destruction of the tenth Decemvirate helm, and acts as the liaison between the Decemvirate and rest of the Society in order to bring greater transparency to the leaders' actions. The Ten usually leave the operations of the Society to the venture-captains, faction leaders, and the three Masters of Scrolls, Spells, and Swords. When the Decemvirate does intervene, they act with decisiveness and pragmatism, and their stern rulings earn the respect, if not admiration, of the Society's agents."
