									"Across the Inner Sea {@deity Abadar} has long been the favored deity of city-dwellers, thanks to his dedication to all things urban. You won't find a city of any size in the region that doesn't boast a sizable temple to honor his tenets of expanding civilization, promoting prosperity, and following the rule of law. This pantheon expands his focus by enjoining the kinder and more uplifting elements of urban life, shifting away from {@deity Abadar||Abadar's} well-known pursuit of wealth to a pursuit of peace and prosperity for everyone in the city. Worshippers of this pantheon invoke {@deity Alseta|LOGM} the Welcomer, who watches over city gates to keep invaders out and defenders safe, as well as {@deity Tanagaar|LOGM} the Aurulent Eye, who keeps a careful eye over those who protect the innocent at night. Adherents to this pantheon also look to {@deity Alseta|LOGM} for guidance in making their cities open and welcoming to all peaceful dwellers therein and for wisdom through the many transitions of urban life; they strive to follow her edict of treating all other beings with courtesy and respect. From {@deity Korada|LOGM}, they draw their inspiration in the pursuit of a peaceful mindset and public policy that enjoins harmony, using the law to support redemption. In another departure from what you'll see as a common Abadaran practice, the worshippers of this pantheon don't build opulent, flashy temples. Their shrines often skew toward the simple, as the Urban Prosperity tends to distribute any money it raises to those causes that promote peace and bring prosperity to all. Services are offered daily at dawn and dusk, typically accompanied by serene music and time for contemplation and meditation. If you find yourself in need of some tranquility, I highly recommend attending."

									"This pantheon originated in the Shackles for perhaps obvious reasons, but its worshippers now spread along most every coastline in the Inner Sea, so don't imagine that this pantheon is just for pirates or the less savory types in the import business\u2014though it certainly appeals to them, too. The flashier deities in this pantheon are the better known, for who doesn't associate {@deity Besmara|LOGM}, the Pirate Queen, with her swashbuckling antics and {@deity Hei Feng|LOGM}, the Duke of Thunder, with the storms survivors still speak of years later? Yet the duality of {@deity Gozreh} and the sustainability and care of {@deity Ylimancha|LOGM} round out this pantheon. The Wind and the Waves and the Harborwing strive for safety and balance between air, land, and sea, and it's for their care that many a frightened, stormtossed seafarer prays during a perilous journey. Followers of this pantheon aren't given to regular worship unless to utter a simple prayer or recitation on the bow of a ship at sea. Instead, the faithful find themselves most pious when the winds, waves, and thunder are in full force, threatening the survival of the ship, or when they pull into harbor after safely enduring a storm. At such times, joyous celebrations of dancing, singing, and pouring out libations to their gods mark their worship. Faithful followers are also committed to rescuing those at sea and have been known to sail into terrifying storms in search of the stranded."

									"The Offering Plate is a pantheon centered on selfless acts, charitable giving, and passing along skills or knowledge to improve the circumstances of those less fortunate. Followers believe {@deity Abadar} agrees the health of a city's economy depends in part upon helping those least fortunate return to the market. Clerics sometimes carry flails that double as collection pots for donations. They find legal loopholes and contractually sound means of channeling funding and supplies to worthy causes in their community. {@deity Alseta|LOGM} reigns over transitions, and worshippers of the Offering Plate ask for her help as they assist those in need to transition from poverty and hardship into the next phase of their lives. Followers call upon {@deity Folgrit|LOGM} for patience and follow her edicts to take in or find homes for those without families. {@deity Kazutal|LOGM} teaches followers of the Offering Plate the ultimate goal of charity is to build a strong and loving community. {@deity Cayden Cailean} reminds them every person deserves to live a life free of oppressive restrains, as well as a little leisure occasionally to lighten their loads. Many followers of the Offering Plate form traveling groups that share their time and wealth with those in need. These caravans are known as Offering Trains and some trains remain on a permanent route that travels between multiple settlements in the Inner Sea. These trains visit prosperous settlements, collecting what supplies and offerings they can, before moving on to deliver these donations to the less fortunate in other locations. One Offering Train has been making its way from Almas, up along the Sellen River, and delivering goods to the people of Mendev and the Sarkoris Scar for a number of years, earning them the title of the Crusader Caravan."

									"This pantheon is widespread across the Inner Sea region, finding adherents among all those who must labor daily, whether in field or forge, city or farm, logging camp or caravan oasis. Such laborers seek strength in all its many forms. They look to {@deity Kurgess|LOGM}, the Strong Man, who was once a laborer himself, for aid in using their full potential, seeking to better themselves and encouraging others to strive toward their own potential, no matter their work. From {@deity Torag}, they take the strength to be honorable and forthright and keep their word. And they look to {@deity Cayden Cailean} not just for the strength to truly enjoy themselves when not working, but also to aid the oppressed. Recently, a small but growing number of followers, especially near {@deity Mzali|LOME}, have been including {@deity Tlehar|LOME}, too, as they seek the mental fortitude to give their best even as they hope each day will be better than the last. You'll find that these laborers won't cheat at honorable contests, swindle you, intentionally make anything subpar, or be mean or standoffish when drunk. Their religious observances tend to be frequent and regular but not at all fussy or lengthy. Ceremonies always seem to include food, drink, and games afterwards\u2014or perhaps as part of the observances themselves. Followers of the Laborer's Bastion clearly place more value in companionship and reassurance of their faith than in following a formal script and getting all the rituals right. Personally, I feel at ease whenever I see their religious symbol\u2014a mug and hammer on a sunburst background\u2014as I know I'm among trustworthy, honest folk... even if we don't share a language or the same idea of what constitutes a decent breakfast."

									"Farmers, foragers, hunters, and some of their urban relatives throughout the Mwangi Expanse look to this pantheon for protection and inspiration, and its popularity is certainly rising beyond the Mwangi, taking hold across the Inner Sea. Whatever the shape of their harvests or the nature of their homes, this pantheon's adherents take seriously the need to live in close harmony with the earth and their communities. They turn to {@deity Adanye|LOME}, the catfolk deity who embodies the warmth of the hearth, and to {@deity Mazludeh|LOME}, known as the Mother of Hearth and Wall, for protection and support of family and community. They look to {@deity Erastil}, that well-known and widely worshipped god of nature, provisioning, home, and community, for aid in the harvest and the hunt. Because their lives are so closely tied to the seasons as much as the home, they look to the powerful {@deity Uvuko|LOME} for comfort and assistance through all such changes. There is little by way of formal worship for this pantheon: its adherents intone a prayer over their morning duties or enact a ritual before a hunt, so worship is usually a daily practice with little fanfare. On occasion, though, their celebrations are truly jubilant. I was fortunate enough to experience one such celebration, some distance outside of Kibwe, in honor of a particularly rich harvest, and the drumming and dancing were second only to the remarkably tasty food. The jungle is a bountiful place and the harvests superb for those who know how to go about them\u2014and how to implore divine aid as they do so."

The deities worshipped by the faithful are a heady and diverse group that shows the true depth of understanding of this pantheon: {@deity Desna} and {@deity Sarenrae}; the empyreal lords {@deity Ashava|LOGM}, {@deity Black Butterfly|LOGM}, and {@deity Pulura|LOGM}; the elven god {@deity Ketephys|LOGM}; and the outer god {@deity Yog-Sothoth|LOGM}. Their religious observances take place at night and center around stargazing. While {@deity Groetus|LOGM} served as the moon in the original pantheon, the god's treatment of spreading hope as anathema has caused many to swap in the Tian deity {@deity Tsukiyo|LOGM} in regions where he's known.",
									"If your travels take you through Nidal, you'll find this pantheon has been gaining ground there against the worship of {@deity Zon-Kuthon}, whose faithful feel they own the worship of the night. A rising number of Cosmic Caravan worshippers in that nation seek to oppose or, one day, even overthrow the Midnight Lord's theocracy to reclaim the night from the implications that all who dwell in the dark are evil."

Yet as mortality evolved, it began harnessing the elements for malevolent purposes, causing anguished dissent between the benevolent elemental lords and emboldening their evil counterparts.

Centers of worship like churches or cathedrals are extremely uncommon. Most followers consider worship to be an individual matter, and it is rare to see a follower of any empyreal lord proselytizing. However, adherents sometimes congregate in small groups called mystery cults, and some of these groups maintain small temples. The city of Magnimar is home to several mystery cults, as the Varisian people have long held the empyreal lords in high esteem. It is not uncommon for mystery cultists to worship multiple empyreal lords in various combinations, or even all of them, though most have a favorite patron.",

In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deeprooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves' impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one's work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag's oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was longestablished even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation."

While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others' expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira's followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. Chaldira is most often depicted as a halfling woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons."

She is now feared among her former peers for her persuasive words that tempt them away from their place in the Abyss and toward redemption.

Before she was trapped in the {@i Gasping Pearl}, the benevolent lord of water patrolled her plane as a powerful sailfish made of coral and streaked with mother of pearl. When she realized her capture was imminent, Lysianassa preserved the last of her strength within the Breath of Lysianassa, a vial that allowed her nautilus servant Riam the Unyielding to control the Plane of Water's tides. Since Riam's death, the currents of the Plane of Water have begun to slow, and may eventually come to a halt. Few recall the Empress of the Torrent's name, but cults dedicated to an enigmatic figure called the Queen of the Depths have begun to arise, heralding an event they refer to as the Awakening, and some planar scholars believe these cultists seek to free Lysianassa from her prison."

The more intricate the problem, the more rewarding the investigation, and through determination and ethical investigation, even the deepest of enigmas can be solved. Calculated, logical thinking is more important to Zohls than gut instinct. She sees patterns everywhere, and she teaches that detecting these patterns brings the truth to light. While all investigations are worth pursuing so long as they don't hurt innocents, investigations that reveal the truth of crimes or other horrors, and that lead to justice being served and victims finding peace, are the most important of all to Verity."

Instead, scholars study and plot aeons' actions, striving to discern the Monad's ultimate goal or to uncover universal truths they can exploit for their own purposes.

											"Based in Ustalav but active in aristocratic salons and cloistered academies across Avistan and Garund, the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye is a mystic order of occultist-nobles who seek philosophical self-awareness and mastery of celestial truths. The order was founded in 3988 ar when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts\u2014both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter\u2014has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 ar. The Esoteric Order's meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened. The order's greatest accomplishment, however, was averting a doomsday few on Golarion will ever realize was imminent: in 4718 ar, the order's greatest heroes prevented the planet Aucturn from devouring Golarion."

Dismayed by the chaos and loss of life, Mazludeh spurred her fellow empyreal lords into action, forming a divine concordance that protected the Garundi nation of Holomog from devastation. Mazludeh's efforts elevated her to true divinity and the status of the matron goddess of the nation of Holomog. Now the goddess of negotiations and treaties, her followers often travel with merchants and ambassadors. She is also considered the diplomat to the other empyreal lords, able to pass on prayers to those most suited to answer them and persuade celestial beings to see to their fulfillment. Throughout the Mwangi, worshippers of Mazludeh have developed a reputation for being brave, empathetic, and fair even to their enemies."
