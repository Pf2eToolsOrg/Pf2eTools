The association of a diverse array of gods and demigods thematically linked with the stars and the spaces between is a relatively new faith that first rose to prominence in western Avistan, particularly in Varisia, Nidal, and Ravounel. The deities worshiped by the faithful of the Cosmic Caravan include: Desna, Groetus, and Sarenrae; the empyreal lords Ashava, Black Butterfly, and Pulura; the elven god Ketephys; and the outer god Yog-Sothoth. This faith has been gaining ground particularly in Nidal, where the worship of the night is overwhelmingly associated with Zon-Kuthon, and a rising number of Cosmic Caravan worshipers seek to oppose or, one day, even overthrow the Midnight Lord's theocracy to reclaim the night from the implications that all who dwell in the dark are evil."]}]},{"name":"Religion","source":"LOME","entries":[{"type":"pf2-h1","name":"Religion","entries":["Natural barriers and vast distances have shaped the Expanse's religions as much as its people, creating a thousand variants comprised of familiar deities and regional faiths. For all the diversity in worship and artistic depiction, common themes unite the Mwangi approach to worship.","At the root of their identities, the gods are symbolic expressions of the Mwangi Expanse's most enduring aspirations and anxieties. Angazhan represents power, dominance, and destruction, just as Grandmother Spider forms the foundation for oral traditions. Walkena's undead existence drives home the narrative of outside invaders, feeding the fears of foreign exploitation. Here the gods are not so much the source of animal strength, cleverness, or hate so much as a means of personifying and translating those concepts, and anyone who would understand the Expanse's people would do well to study their faiths.","Yet the gods are also very real. Supernatural haunts and beasts are proof of their influence and reason enough to offer prayers for protection. Celestials and fiends alike enact their patrons' will in the material world. Even priests perform minor miracles on a daily basis, driving home that the divine are as powerful and worthy of awe as ever. However, for all the deities' cosmic importance, their role in most Mwangi societies takes on a humbler role, treated in everyday parlance more like eccentric relatives or disquieting neighbors whom it's best not to rouse than omnipotent beings—all the more so, given some groups' genealogies identifying one or more gods as distant ancestors. Unwelcome rain might be cause to chide Gozreh aloud, and on hot days far from Mzali, someone might reprimand Walkena that this is no time to play with fire. Elsewhere it's high praise at the end of a tale to tease a talented storyteller as if she were Grandmother Spider masquerading in mortal form, mock-scolding her for ignoring earlier prayers.","This behavior stems partly from desensitization to the supernatural; magic is so prevalent in the Expanse it can seem at times mundane. More importantly, though, this casual divine banter originates in the thousands of myths of the various gods tricking, fighting, thwarting, stealing from, and flirting with one another, immortalizing the gods' supposed exploits in a humbling light. The gods aren't aloof; they're present and approachable for any so bold as to call on them. Just so did Holomog's ancestors beseech the Empyreal Lords to negotiate the Celestial Concordance, and just so can anyone from lay person to priest petition the divine—or hold their gods accountable. Nowhere is this better illustrated than Mzali, where the god Walkena walks among the same people who a century earlier deemed their three sun gods complacent and cast the trio aside.","For all the power they bring, these pacts are binding. Walkena shelters Mzali's people yet demands supplication. Angazhan grants strength at the cost of control. Even Holomog's celestial obedience carries strictures its citizens can't easily ignore. Here the favored faiths remain at their strongest, often from sincere reverence but sometimes because any hint of blasphemy invites severe punishment.","Yet even these more demanding faiths are the exception rather than the rule. Most areas celebrate a host of divinities, from familiar gods to more obscure, local patrons. Senghor's reverence of Abadar coexists with strong Gozren faith. Kibwe is awash with hundreds of Zenj household deities imported by traders from across the Expanse. Bloodcove's longtime connection to the Shackles has provided a foothold for Besmara's clerics, even as many inhabitants have become desensitized to thieves smuggling out sacred relics from inland faiths. Even in Nantambu, where Jatembe's millennia-old magical traditions offer a compelling alternative to divine power, shrines to Shelyn, Irez, Nethys, and more find homes.","At its core, faith is like so much else in the Mwangi Expanse: a diverse, ageless, occasionally dangerous reflection of its history and people, all too often misunderstood by outside observers."]}]},{"name":"Gods of the Inner Sea","source":"LOGM","entries":[{"type":"pf2-h1","name":"Gods of the Inner Sea","entries":["The gods venerated—or feared—by the people of the Inner Sea region are as diverse as the people themselves.

When the Material Plane was born, the benevolent elemental lords seeded it with all the potential of their elements, creating planets, stars, oceans, and life. Yet as mortality evolved, it began harnessing the elements for malevolent purposes, causing anguished dissent between the benevolent elemental lords and emboldening their evil counterparts. Kelizandri, the fearsome lord of water, forged an alliance with the other evil elemental lords— Ayrzul, Hshurha, and Ymeri—to seal each good elemental lord in a prison penetrable only by combining the other three elemental powers once more; this feat has been achieved only once in the ages since.

Drawn from the most powerful ranks of the celestial host, the multitudinous empyreal lords include agathions, angels, archons, and azatas alike. Most of these beings gained prominence as immortal champions of virtue, though some are instead mortal paragons who ascended, while others spontaneously formed from exceptional deeds of good that echoed throughout the planes. While all empyreal lords are dedicated to good, their philosophies, interests, and personalities vary, and they don't always agree with one another.","Worship of the empyreal lords is not nearly as widespread as that of the major deities, but it is still surprisingly common. Most worship takes place at small shrines, statues, or artifacts (such as the sculpture known as the Mistress of Angels in Magnimar), or simply through the doing of deeds that reflect an empyreal lord's interest or beliefs. Centers of worship like churches or cathedrals are extremely uncommon. Most followers consider worship to be an individual matter, and it is rare to see a follower of any empyreal lord proselytizing. However, adherents sometimes congregate in small groups called mystery cults, and some of these groups maintain small temples. The city of Magnimar is home to several mystery cults, as the Varisian people have long held the empyreal lords in high esteem. It is not uncommon for mystery cultists to worship multiple empyreal lords in various combinations, or even all of them, though most have a favorite patron.","Presented below are some of the empyreal lords commonly worshipped in the Inner Sea region."]}]},{"name":"The Horsemen","source":"LOGM","entries":[{"type":"pf2-h1","name":"The Horsemen","entries":["At the end of the River Styx await the rulers of Abaddon: the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and their daemonic brood.

The slaughter of fellow mortals for the glory of distant, unfathomable beings is not something that should be permitted within a society. Instead, mortal beings must shape their own fate, aware of their own limitations, trusting in their reliance upon one another and their shared values rather than divine intervention and guidance.
