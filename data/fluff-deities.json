								"In the city-state of Mzali in the Mwangi Expanse resides an undead being of immense power, a child-sized god-king. In the past, Walkena was a mortal descendant of the gods that ruled over Mzali in ancient times, one of the sun kings from an old empire and a golden age of the city. Ages later, his preserved body was found by members of the Council of Mwanyisa, who ruled Mzali at that time. Believing him to be an omen of the city's impending resurgence, the council took him to put him on display in Mzali. When an army from the Sargavan city of Kalabuto attacked the city, Walkena awoke\u2014this time as an undead creature\u2014and slew each of the invaders in a purging rain of fire.",
								"Walkena is entirely different from how he was before his death. A sense of kindness and compassion was once common in his disposition, but after his revival he became controlling and unwavering. The young sun king previously embodied a gentle compassion; now he has become harsh like the summer sun. He purifies, but at a terrible cost.",
								"Walkena's stance is that all residents of the Mwangi Expanse are bonded, that they must all practice unity. Those whom associate and conspire with outsiders are traitors and a danger. Although his means are not always considered good, he will do anything to protect his people, so long as they do not defy him. To restore his homeland to the glory it once held is his greatest goal.",
								"Though cruel in his rule and terrifying to his enemies, for a long time, Walkena was one of the strongest points of resistance against colonial forces and the exploitation of the Mwangi Expanse. Many were reluctant to confront the child-god's abuses, fearful of criticizing one of the Mwangi people's most prominent defenders. Walkena's seeming disdain for the new nation of Vidrian has many worried that Walkena might be more harmful than helpful in the long run. Despite this, Walkena remains a compelling figure to many. His grace comes through in every action and word he speaks. He blesses those that have dedicated themselves to the Mwangi Expanse. Walkena does not preach great rewards after death, but instead speaks to greatness in life."

						"Once a mortal child-king of Mzali, Walkena bore the power of his ancestors, the Old Sun Gods. He was a fair but stern ruler, little given to petulant temper tantrums of other children his age. As a young king, he was already fond of order and enjoyed using laws and policies to rule Mzali and the lands around it. Walkena was quite wary of outsiders, as they did not adhere to, or even respect, the strict laws placed upon them when visiting his ancient city. Yet the foreigners were essential, his advisors assured him, for trade is what made Mzali strong and wealthy, allowing Walkena and the advisors to adorn themselves in gold and fine cloth.",
						"As he grew\u2014though still a child\u2014Walkena began to believe his advisors were wrong. Outsiders brought wealth, but they also brought irreverence and turmoil. Through a series of increasingly strict laws, Walkena first limited non-Mwangi trade in his city, and then banned it entirely. He felt that those who violated his laws needed to be made an example to others, and his methods of punishment were cruel.",
						"Walkena's advisors disliked the young king's cruelty, but they disliked the loss of their influence and their finery even more. When those who went to Walkena directly were executed for their temerity, the advisors instead beseeched the Old Sun Gods themselves, begging for the power to stop Walkena.",
						"The Old Sun Gods listened. They had also seen Walkena grow cruel, but he shut out their whispered promptings for compassion. With little other recourse, the Old Sun Gods instilled the power-hungry advisors with a fraction of their divine might. These imbued advisors called themselves the Council of Mwanyisa after mwan, a particularly fine style of stark white cloth which Walkena's draconian and xenophobic decrees had made difficult to procure. No member of the council could match Walkena for power, but together, they possessed enough might to overthrow him. Walkena fled to his bedchamber where he was later found slain, although the killer was never identified. Priests still loyal to the slain childking stole his corpse and buried him within a hidden tomb, in the manner of his ancestors.",
						"The council immediately instilled its own order, returning trade to Mzali but keeping many of Walkena's legal reforms that allowed them, as the city's new leaders, to severely and indiscriminately punish outsiders. The Old Sun Gods sought to pull their power back, but the canniest among the council had tied their borrowed divine power tightly to their souls, and the Old Sun Gods were unable to take back what they had freely given.",
						"The Council of Mwanyisa passed rule to its descendants, but the divine power thinned in each generation. Unlike the line of sun kings, it was not theirs to keep. Soon, only law and tradition, rather than divine might, empowered the council to rule. Foreigners began to take advantage of Mzali's weakening leadership, and a series of floods and plagues practically depopulated the city.",
						"Yet hope was found deep in one of the old tombs: the mummified child-king Walkena and the treasures with which he'd been buried. The mummified body was put on display in the grandest temple in the city's center. News of the city's resurgence and newfound wealth\u2014in truth, stories embellished by the council's agents desperate to restore Mzali's relevance\u2014spread across the land.",
						"A century ago, Chelaxian colonists from Sargava marched to Mzali to plunder its riches and conquer the city. In a bright flash of sunlight, the mummified body of Walkena sprang to life, calling down the sun to punish the invaders. The Chelaxians were incinerated, and the gold adornments of Mzali shone like new. The mummified god-king had returned to lead his city in its hour of greatest need.",
						"Walkena wasted no time in asserting control, and the people of Mzali soon learned that death had exacerbated Walkena's xenophobia and cruelty, instead of tempering them. Walkena kept the Council of Mwanyisa as his advisors; they were, after all, adept at administering the city and unable to murder him now that he was both undead and wholly divine. He established a caste of priests to erase any evidence of the Old Sun Gods and place Walkena alone as the patron and god of Mzali.",
						"The powers of a god can work wonders, and Walkena still loved the people native to his city. He sheltered them from outside influences, providing them with safety and security at the price of unquestioned loyalty. Many in Mzali see Walkena as their savior, and Mwangi people from across the continent flocked to Mzali to share its wealth and venerate its god-king. Walkena is no longer an indecisive child but a stern ruler whose word is absolute law.",

								"Walkena is still a boy in appearance, although his apparent age changes based on the time of day. When the sun is at his highest, he seems oldest: perhaps 13 or 14 years of age. He seems no older than 10 or 11 at dawn and dusk, and at night he shrivels to the size of a sickly toddler. Walkena always retires to his chambers in the Temple of the Deathless Child before dark so that no one other than his closest and most trusted advisors see him in his diminutive state. His once-dark skin has faded to the pallor of a corpse, and he still wears the wrappings from his mummification beneath his fine clothes and heavy gold adornment. He is never seen without his radiant crown of gold, carved to depict the rays of the shining sun.",
								"Walkena's mood also shifts throughout the day. He is optimistic and lively at dawn; he's usually seen smiling, and he's prone to make hasty decisions or even forgive minor slights. He often walks among the populace of Mzali in the morning, beaming radiantly at citizens who know better than to show anything but complete devotion to their god-king and his bodyguards. By noon, Walkena is at his greatest strength and his most unyielding demeanor, so it's at this time each day that he leads the daily worship from atop the Temple of the Deathless Child at the city's heart. He likes to meet with dignitaries and the council near midday, as they're least likely to take advantage of his upbeat morning moods. If Walkena is rendering punishment for crimes so egregious as to warrant his personal attention (for which he typically demands execution), he's most likely to do so in the middle of the day. By evening, he becomes suspicious and paranoid, often meeting just before sunset with his secret police to arrange disappearances of his enemies, real or imagined.",
								"Walkena's realm is the city of Mzali. By his own design, few people can think of the city without also thinking of Walkena, as the god-king and his domain are inseparable. Mzali has healthy industries and vibrant markets, and more people move to the city each year, but it's far from full. Empty temples, manors, and storehouses are found throughout the city, and finding a place to live and work is still very easy. The western necropolis in the city is barred from casual settlement or exploration, and the tombs and temples there likely hold secrets of the Old Sun Gods that Walkena prefers forgotten."

								"Walkena expects to one day receive no less than total adoration from every native inhabitant of the Mwangi Expanse. For now, however, he keeps his attention on the city of Mzali and the fields, farms, and jungles surrounding it. Within this domain, he is strict in the application of his law and expects his worshippers to be equally strict in adhering to it.",
								"All followers of Walkena are expected to stop what they're doing at noon to venerate the sun. Within Mzali, massive gongs ring out across the city at noon to alert everyone to the time of prayers. These prayers are generally silent, with worshippers keeping their heads uncovered and bowed in contemplation while the sun beats down upon them. Prayers usually last usually no more than a few minutes, for Walkena's worshippers know that laboring for their community and their god is important, and they must not shirk, even for a moment of quiet prayer.",
								"During Mzali's noon prayers, Walkena looks down upon the city from the highest balcony in the Temple of the Deathless Child. Although he previously did so merely to bask in the adoration of the crowds and occasionally give a short speech encouraging diligence and faithfulness, he's now more apt to eye the praying crowds suspiciously, seeking signs of slackened piety. He has not failed to notice that more and more citizens stay indoors, out of his sight, rather than stand in the hot sun beneath his gaze. Noon devotions aren't required by law, but Walkena is contemplating making it mandatory for all.",
								"Walkena is a god of the sun, and he thus considers night to be oppositional to his nature and his rule. Although he doesn't expressly forbid the people of Mzali from being out between sunset and sunrise, few of his followers are active after dark. Walkena's secret police are most active at night, questioning travelers, breaking up meetings, and rounding up those they suspect of conspiring out of Walkena's blazing sight."

								"Mzali is known as the TempleCity for good reason: enormous stone temples from Mzali's ancient days loom above the city, their domes and spires piercing the sky. Most are made of the same palecolored sandstone, but a distinction between two types of temples is immediately apparent: those dedicated to Walkena are adorned with gleaming gold and carefully tended, while those dedicated to other gods are crumbling and have been stripped of all their ornamentation and finery long ago. Walkena has commanded the removal of all traces of the older gods of his bloodline that once ruled the city (that is, the Old Sun Gods and their quasidivine mortal descendants who preceded Walkena). These disintegrating temples are thus left hollow and forlorn. Walkena doesn't mind his people paying homage to other gods in private as long as Walkena's supremacy is acknowledged, but he wants to avoid active public services that might compete with his own. Pious masons and smiths sometimes work together to restore these forgotten temples and dedicate them to Walkena. If they find hidden chambers containing forgotten treasures or evidence of the redacted gods once worshipped there, they are usually wise enough to keep silent.",
								"Walkena's main temple, and the centerpiece of all Mzali, is the Temple of the Deathless Child at Mzali's heart. This temple has always been the largest, but during Walkena's time as a mortal ruler, it was built higher and wider than ever before. The Council of Mwanyisa used the temple as its headquarters for the generations of its rule after unseating Walkena, but it did little to strip the temple of its religious trappings because the omnipresent reminder of the child-king they'd deposed was useful to instill loyalty. When Walkena returned a century ago, he immediately took over his former temple, gave it the name it bears today, and has been working to expand it yet further.",
								"The temple's most significant feature, to Walkena, is the wide balcony at the top of the temple where he appears at noon on all but the rainiest days. From here, he leads everyone within view\u2014which is nearly all of the city\u2014in a daily prayer to honor himself and the sun. In Mzali, they are one and the same.",
								"Other chambers in the Temple of the Deathless God include long corridors with statues of past heroes and minor gods of Mzali, all kept where they are both physically and figuratively lower than Walkena himself. The temple's highest level contains Walkena's throne room, the personal chambers to which he retires after dark, and other balconies from which he can observe the city at dawn and dusk. Members of the Council of Mwanyisa and Walkena's other personal advisors jockey for the best offices, galleries, and shrines that let them work closest to their god-king.",
								"The Temple of the Deathless Child is heavily guarded by both living soldiers and undead guards. The former often become the latter; devoted mortals in Walkena's service swear an oath to serve the god-king even after death. When slain, they immediately arise as zombies under Walkena's absolute control. It's something of an open secret that Walkena also inflicts undeath upon his enemies, as he delights in turning his former foes into mindless, loyal guardians. Thus, his undead guards might contain animated corpses of devout soldiers standing next to former rebels, all serving together with unceasing loyalty."

								"Walkena's priests are the elite of Mzali, and the only ones permitted to wear bright yellow clothing that evokes Walkena's golden raiment. Although all priests are above the common people of Mzali, there are ranks within the priesthood that engender intense intrigue and conflict.",
								"The high priests are those who advise Walkena and carry out his direct commands. They live within the Temple of the Deathless Child in unparalleled luxury, and they generally pass their titles to their descendants. Although the powers of the high priests faded when the Council of Mwanyisa ruled Mzali, they nevertheless maintained their role as civic administrators, and some high priests can trace their family's membership in the priesthood back for dozens of generations. The most influential priest is also the head of the Council of Mwanyisa and is expected to keep the rest of the council, as well as all the lower-ranking priests, firmly in line. The current head priest is a stoic but harried man named {@b Zubari} (LE male human priest of Walkena 15).",
								"The middle rank of priests, or technical priests, maintain smaller temples and shrines to Walkena across the city and, more rarely, in surrounding communities. They engage in the rites common to priests everywhere: blessing marriages, healing the sick, and resolving disputes. They also serve as Walkena's eyes and ears in the city, as they report any suspicious activities or disloyalty among the people to whom they minister.",
								"Many part-time priests of Walkena have other careers but dedicate a significant portion of their free time for a 3-year period as a sign of devotion. A prospective lesser priest must engage in rites of purification and tests of loyalty before joining, and most do so by informing on disloyal family members to Walkena's secret police. Though devout, these lesser priests almost never advance to higher ranks of the priesthood and are little more than laborers for their superiors, receiving food or small rewards in exchange for their service."

								"Followers of Walkena observe only one holy day: the Day of the Cleaning Sun, when Walkena's mummified corpse sprang to life to bring brilliant retribution down upon the Chelaxian invaders. As the only day set aside for celebration in Mzali, it is a riotous and raucous affair, with face painting, parades, and feasting common throughout the city. Many in the city simply call the day Cleansing, though citizens who want to emphatically remind foreigners of the event sometimes call it Retribution Day. Yet even this celebration in his honor does little to stir joy within Walkena, as he spends the day carefully observing whether anyone is celebrating with less than wholehearted vigor.",
								"The blood of the Old Sun Gods flowed through Walkena's veins when he was alive, and its residue remains in the mummified husk of his walking corpse. This residue twitches within him on days sacred to the Old Sun Gods. Walkena becomes particularly irritable and cruel on Tlehar's sacred Rustbreaking Day or Luhar's sacred week of Longdreaming, as though to distract himself from the pull of his ancestors."

There are thus many aphorisms that Walkena's faithful use, though most are simply the idle fancies of the petulant god-king who considers himself more poetic than he actually is.",
								"{@b If It's Not a Friend, It's a Foe:} This saying illustrates the stark duality of Walkena's perspective. The people of Mzali are to be trusted and protected, but those from outside the city can bring destruction and ruin and should be assumed to be enemies. This saying is often used to warn others to break off an interaction with a stranger, sometimes even before the stranger has a chance to speak.",

								"{@b If You Lack Strength to Lead, Have Loyalty to Follow:} Class divides are strong within Mzali, and this saying emphasizes that divide by characterizing those in the working class as being weak of will and lacking in power.

								"The city of Mzali has had a multitude of holy texts over its many thousands of years of existence, though each set of text was hidden or destroyed by successors when necessary to cement their power. Mzali's sealed temples and tombs hold many fragmentary bits of sacred lore, and a complete reconstruction across Mzali's long history is now completely impossible. Among the treasure uncovered with the child-mummy Walkena was a series of wide golden spearheads etched with tiny writing. Each bears the words, {@i Power, Protection, and Protocols} around the collar where the spearhead would attach to a haft. Taken together, these etchings constitute a code of religious principles and fundamental laws. Walkena doesn't remember enough of his mortal life to recall whether Power, Protection, and Protocols was a text he commanded to be written or something handed down from a previous ruler, but as they demand unquestioning obedience to him, he's adopted the text as his own.",
								"Most of Walkena's priests bear strips of cloth with all the text of {@i Power, Protection, and Protocols} stitched upon them with words nearly too small to read. At night, they keep their long strip wrapped around their bodies underneath their night-clothing to mimic Walkena's repose in mummification. Although few priests have memorized the entirety of {@i Power, Protection, and Protocols}, nearly all worshippers know its first lines: \"Before we learn words or how to praise, the sun is there, guiding us to rise and burning away those who would harm us.\"",
								"Although not deemed a holy text on par with {@i Power, Protection, and Protocols}, followers of Walkena keep a careful watch for the so-called \"tablets of fire,\" ancient tablets with prophecies about Mzali's resurgence. The prophecies upon these tablets might refer to leaders other than Walkena; indeed, some of them might be read to predict Walkena's downfall. Walkena's priests freely share those tablets that have been \"correctly interpreted\" to support Walkena's rule and hide those tablets that they can't spin to be wholly supportive of their god-king. Redactors work hard to make the slightest possible revisions to the tablets of fire\u2014an extra character here, a lacuna there\u2014to bolster their god's credibility even further."

Walkena has little interaction with other gods, as he's focused on his own realm, so conflicts between Walkena's faith and other faiths normally arise among worshippers instead of between the deities themselves.",

The association of a diverse array of gods and demigods thematically linked with the stars and the spaces between is a relatively new faith that first rose to prominence in western Avistan, particularly in Varisia, Nidal, and Ravounel. The deities worshiped by the faithful of the Cosmic Caravan include: Desna, Groetus, and Sarenrae; the empyreal lords Ashava, Black Butterfly, and Pulura; the elven god Ketephys; and the outer god Yog-Sothoth. This faith has been gaining ground particularly in Nidal, where the worship of the night is overwhelmingly associated with Zon-Kuthon, and a rising number of Cosmic Caravan worshipers seek to oppose or, one day, even overthrow the Midnight Lord's theocracy to reclaim the night from the implications that all who dwell in the dark are evil."

						"Natural barriers and vast distances have shaped the Expanse's religions as much as its people, creating a thousand variants comprised of familiar deities and regional faiths. For all the diversity in worship and artistic depiction, common themes unite the Mwangi approach to worship.",
						"At the root of their identities, the gods are symbolic expressions of the Mwangi Expanse's most enduring aspirations and anxieties. Angazhan represents power, dominance, and destruction, just as Grandmother Spider forms the foundation for oral traditions. Walkena's undead existence drives home the narrative of outside invaders, feeding the fears of foreign exploitation. Here the gods are not so much the source of animal strength, cleverness, or hate so much as a means of personifying and translating those concepts, and anyone who would understand the Expanse's people would do well to study their faiths.",
						"Yet the gods are also very real. Supernatural haunts and beasts are proof of their influence and reason enough to offer prayers for protection. Celestials and fiends alike enact their patrons' will in the material world. Even priests perform minor miracles on a daily basis, driving home that the divine are as powerful and worthy of awe as ever. However, for all the deities' cosmic importance, their role in most Mwangi societies takes on a humbler role, treated in everyday parlance more like eccentric relatives or disquieting neighbors whom it's best not to rouse than omnipotent beings\u2014all the more so, given some groups' genealogies identifying one or more gods as distant ancestors. Unwelcome rain might be cause to chide Gozreh aloud, and on hot days far from Mzali, someone might reprimand Walkena that this is no time to play with fire. Elsewhere it's high praise at the end of a tale to tease a talented storyteller as if she were Grandmother Spider masquerading in mortal form, mock-scolding her for ignoring earlier prayers.",
						"This behavior stems partly from desensitization to the supernatural; magic is so prevalent in the Expanse it can seem at times mundane. More importantly, though, this casual divine banter originates in the thousands of myths of the various gods tricking, fighting, thwarting, stealing from, and flirting with one another, immortalizing the gods' supposed exploits in a humbling light. The gods aren't aloof; they're present and approachable for any so bold as to call on them. Just so did Holomog's ancestors beseech the Empyreal Lords to negotiate the Celestial Concordance, and just so can anyone from lay person to priest petition the divine\u2014or hold their gods accountable. Nowhere is this better illustrated than Mzali, where the god Walkena walks among the same people who a century earlier deemed their three sun gods complacent and cast the trio aside.",
						"For all the power they bring, these pacts are binding. Walkena shelters Mzali's people yet demands supplication. Angazhan grants strength at the cost of control. Even Holomog's celestial obedience carries strictures its citizens can't easily ignore. Here the favored faiths remain at their strongest, often from sincere reverence but sometimes because any hint of blasphemy invites severe punishment.",
						"Yet even these more demanding faiths are the exception rather than the rule. Most areas celebrate a host of divinities, from familiar gods to more obscure, local patrons. Senghor's reverence of Abadar coexists with strong Gozren faith. Kibwe is awash with hundreds of Zenj household deities imported by traders from across the Expanse. Bloodcove's longtime connection to the Shackles has provided a foothold for Besmara's clerics, even as many inhabitants have become desensitized to thieves smuggling out sacred relics from inland faiths. Even in Nantambu, where Jatembe's millennia-old magical traditions offer a compelling alternative to divine power, shrines to Shelyn, Irez, Nethys, and more find homes.",

These demigods have risen above their peers through strength, cunning, or an unmatched capacity for cruelty, overseeing innumerable lesser demons that serve, fear, and revile them. Beneath them, yet more demons clamor to attain their heights of power as nascent demon lords, waiting for the right opportunity to complete their ascension. Fortunately for the mortals of the world, while the ranks of the demon lords are numerous beyond comprehension, only a small subset have so intensely turned their baleful gazes toward Golarion as to have a presence on the planet. These demon lords are served by vile cults that commit atrocities and blasphemies in exchange for power, wealth, and the opportunity to indulge their hearts' darkest desires."

With two lords of air, two of earth, two of fire, and two of water, half their number represent the aspects of each element that mortals consider benevolent, while the others represent the malicious and destructive aspects of those same elements. When the Material Plane was born, the benevolent elemental lords seeded it with all the potential of their elements, creating planets, stars, oceans, and life. Yet as mortality evolved, it began harnessing the elements for malevolent purposes, causing anguished dissent between the benevolent elemental lords and emboldening their evil counterparts. Kelizandri, the fearsome lord of water, forged an alliance with the other evil elemental lords\u2014 Ayrzul, Hshurha, and Ymeri\u2014to seal each good elemental lord in a prison penetrable only by combining the other three elemental powers once more; this feat has been achieved only once in the ages since. The four surviving lords have ruled their respective planes mercilessly for time uncounted, free to write the stories of their own creations, invent their own titles of nobility, and claim sole dominion over the elemental planes."

Most worship takes place at small shrines, statues, or artifacts (such as the sculpture known as the Mistress of Angels in Magnimar), or simply through the doing of deeds that reflect an empyreal lord's interest or beliefs. Centers of worship like churches or cathedrals are extremely uncommon. Most followers consider worship to be an individual matter, and it is rare to see a follower of any empyreal lord proselytizing. However, adherents sometimes congregate in small groups called mystery cults, and some of these groups maintain small temples. The city of Magnimar is home to several mystery cults, as the Varisian people have long held the empyreal lords in high esteem. It is not uncommon for mystery cultists to worship multiple empyreal lords in various combinations, or even all of them, though most have a favorite patron.",

Followers work to advance the shared interests of their pantheon, directing prayers to whichever god presides over their current activity or circumstance. At the GM's discretion, champions and clerics can dedicate themselves to a pantheon. In such cases, the characters still worship a specific patron deity among those in the pantheon, but also follow the edicts and anathema of the pantheon as a whole. A character who worships a pantheon this way can gain the domains, alternate domains, and spells from the pantheon instead of those from their patron deity. They must uphold the ideals of both their patron deity and the pantheon, though the patron deity's edicts and anathema take precedence. For example, a worshipper of Iomedae could worship the Godclaw, but they wouldn't take the tyranny domain, as it would be in conflict with Iomedae's edicts. In rare cases, a character can worship a pantheon without following a patron deity. Such cases are unique and subject to GM approval."

											"Asmodeus is the First, the Dark Prince, the lord of darkness and law, and the ruler of the plane of Hell. If Asmodeus's own scriptures are to believed\u2014and they are corroborated by certain other accounts, like the angel-penned Book of the Damned\u2014he is one of the oldest beings of the multiverse. These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys's act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline. These claims contradict other popular creation myths, and both theologians and immortal agents of the gods doubt Asmodeus's claims to varying degrees, but while there is no evidence to prove them, they are also difficult to refute.",
											"Asmodeus can take any form he wishes. His best-known depiction, however, is the appearance he is given in popular art: an ancient being with striking red skin and black horns and hooves, surrounded with a pale aura of flames. He is shown either bearing a long contract scroll and a vicious -looking flaming mace, or seated upon a throne ruling over hordes of devils above the apocalyptic landscape of Hell. Asmodeus is known to be eloquent, tactful, patient, and incredibly brilliant, but when angered, he is wrathful and terrifying.",
											"Despite his fiendish depiction and the widespread knowledge of his disdain for free will, many mortals worship Asmodeus. Setting aside the question of good and evil (he most certainly is evil), Asmodeus is an immensely powerful divine being\u2014perhaps one of the most powerful in existence. He represents strict discipline, as he was a being of order long before the concepts of right and wrong were created. This representation of Asmodeus as a champion of law means that his worship is not limited to cults and hushed whispers.",
											"Even though it is heavily frowned upon in most areas of the world, his worship is nevertheless widespread and occasionally, in cases like the nation of Cheliax, the primary religion of a region.",
											"Servitors of Asmodeus include power-hungry priests, diabolists, lawyers, and the decadent nobility of Hell-bound regions like Cheliax. These followers find the inherent structure of Hell a virtue and even seek to emulate it through clever use of the law. Making use of such order allows followers to vie for higher positions of power, usually by taking advantage of complicated bureaucracies. This is a skill that most Asmodeans share, as the church's holy text, the Asmodean Monograph, is itself a tome with several supplemental volumes and appendices that together require a deep understanding to even navigate, much less exploit. Asmodeans are careful in their pursuit of power, however, as a quick ascension or an overextension can leave one vulnerable to those intent on finding weakness.",
											"Beyond his clerics and priests, Asmodeus has hold over several other types of worshippers. Soldiers and other martially minded individuals might welcome Asmodeus's gifts and the dogma of force and dominance required to wield them, but regardless of their role, anyone seeking great power or wealth likely finds themself facing the Dark Prince's temptations. These might take the form of a local Asmodean priest offering such gifts through questionable yet technically legal means. Other times, devils appear to offer literal infernal contracts accepting the signer's soul in exchange for greater abilities, such as spellcasting or the ability to summon that devil.",
											"Temples of Asmodeus vary greatly from region to region, depending on the faith's reception. Public temples to the Dark Prince typically feature gothic or baroque architecture. In Cheliax, his temples sometimes double as government buildings or share space with such structures. Inside, bureaucrats, judges, and other government workers use their understanding of contracts and laws to maintain the infernal machine of order. In places less open to worship of Asmodeus, his temples may be secret sites, such as hidden shrines in personal homes or concealed temples accessible only via secret doors and halls."

The Vault is home to the perfect longsword, the perfect shield, the perfect songbird, the perfect hammer, and even a perfect law. His followers do their best to emulate these perfect forms in their own way, whether through crafting a work of art, raising strong and healthy livestock, or passing laws that best serve the people in a community.",
											"The holy book of Abadar's worshippers, {@i The Order of Numbers}, commands his followers to build cities and settlements where there are none, to work hard and trade in pursuit of wealth, and to follow the law while doing so. If a profession is a lawful part of society, it is ordained by Abadar. As such, those who work at the behest of government often pay homage to Abadar, as do others who directly benefit from the rule of law and trade. Naturally, those who oppose the law or actively work against it\u2014such as thieves, criminals, bandits, and pirates\u2014are enemies of the church and society as Abadar sees it. Despite this, some heretical factions of Abadar's worshippers twist the words of {@i The Order of Numbers} for their own purposes to pursue wealth over all. They justify their criminal behavior with the holy words of order and wealth while subverting the rule of law on technicalities, undermining law-abiding institutions.",
											"As the god of cities and laws, Abadar is a stern but just master. He rewards those who work hard and looks down on those who would cheat the system for their own gains. Abadar understands that not everyone gets a fair deal in the world of mortals, but he encourages his clergy to support laws that are as equitable as possible, enabling those of lower status to rise. The church frowns on slavery, believing that trade should always be fair and that no price offered can ever compensate the entirety of a creature's life and labor.",
											"Clerics of Abadar labor to help their communities grow and flourish. They seek to aid in the passage of effective laws and encourage bringing order to places where it is absent. When ministering to their congregants, clerics wear robes of white silk with accents of gold that show the wealth of their church. Temples dedicated to Abadar are fortified, as they often serve double duty as banks, moneylenders, and currency exchanges. Despite this practical purpose, these temples tend to be highly decorated, commonly featuring elegant architecture adorned with gold and stained-glass windows.",
											"The church of Abadar in Avistan feels it must charge for its divine services in tribute to the god of merchants, but his servants seek to handle matters of public health and safety quickly, and without requiring payment. Priests are also encouraged to strike out on business ventures as a holy duty to enrich the church. These holy ventures often put members of an individual church and those of neighboring churches in competition. Such competition is seen as healthy and often encouraged; however, church law forbids clergy from harming one another, including during warfare on behalf of opposed nations or kingdoms. As a result, Abadarans often act as a neutral negotiators between warring nations\u2014for a fee, of course.",
											"Through {@i The Order of Numbers}, Abadar teaches his clergy that following the law leads to wealth and comfort, and thus happiness. He teaches that discipline leads to keen judgment, which in turn leads to favorable deals, whether they relate to commerce, law, or other types of negotiations. While Abadar encourages the expansion of ordered society, he rejects hasty action and advises caution in all things. Abadaran clergy pass these tenets on to their congregations, teaching the layfolk about trade and commerce as a system for happiness. These teachings also impart the ideals of fairness and following the spirit of the law, while still respecting the letter thereof. One of the church's most important lessons is the value of cooperation between citizens, as community is paramount to the health of a town and kingdom. However, they also recognize that self-interest is most individuals' strongest motivation to increase their own standing and wealth."

											"As symbolized by the three daggers of her religious symbol, Calistria has three aspects: lust, revenge, and trickery. Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her\u2014though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.",
											"Though she is one of several elven deities, Calistria is by far the best known outside of elven communities, and thus many non-elves view her as the representative (or even the only) elven goddess. This conclusion is not entirely unreasonable, as Calistria represents those aspects of the elven ancestry that many other people see as alluring, intriguing, and fascinating. Among elves, she embodies characteristics endemic to elven culture and identity, such as free-spirited pursuit of one's own path, and further embodies a truth lost on shorter-lived peoples: the flexibility and capriciousness of Calistria provides a model for maintaining perspective and composure over a centuries-long lifespan. As a result, she is closely associated with the elven people by elves and others alike. Of the elven deities, she receives by far the most worship from non-elves.",
											"As the goddess's whims are ever-shifting, her worshippers are also often somewhat transient. Even among elves, worship of Calistria is usually intermittent or secondary to faith in another deity. Prayers to Calistria arise from individuals who find themselves driven by lust, engaged in trickery, or driven to revenge, and the people offering those prayers may have no commitment to the faith beyond the prayer offered in that moment. As followers' lives lead them in different directions, they move on to other deities, just as the goddess herself moves from one lover to the next to suit her shifting interests. This personal freedom is a value held dear by the goddess and her followers alike, and perhaps one of the most central values to elven society as a whole. Some of Calistria's most devoted followers work to promote this tenet, quietly working to undermine tyrannical governments, exacting revenge upon slavers and freeing their captives, or simply demonstrating the benefits of a freedom-driven lifestyle.",

The church frowns on slavery, believing that trade should always be fair and that no price offered can ever compensate the entirety of a creature's life and labor.",
											"Organized worship of Calistria is most common among elves, as befits an elven deity. Though rumor would suggest all her temples are brothels, these gathering spaces are often more akin to intellectual salons\u2014albeit more encouraging and supportive of sexual interaction between attendees than most equivalent secular institutions. Others function more akin to a thieves' guild, providing a place to sow and reap rumors, plot acts of questionable legality, and perhaps also engage in lust-driven interactions\u2014all activities suitable to take place behind closed doors.",
											"Clerics of the goddess endeavor to hold the three aspects of their goddess in balance, as a lifetime in service to any one can easily become monotonous, and Calistria abhors her followers becoming overly consumed by a single pursuit. Champions are sometimes more focused, such as those who dedicate themselves to fighting slavery, but even these are careful to avoid becoming so wrapped up in their work that they lose sight of the other aspects of life that make it worth living.",
											"Special rituals, conducted as needed, include invocations of the goddess's blessing when a worshipper begins pursuit of a desired lover, divinations to determine her approval or disapproval of set courses of revenge, initiation rites for those who wish to devote themselves to the faith, and birth and death ceremonies. But Calistria's faith places little stock in marriage; between the goddess's own shifting interests and the mercurial nature of relationships between long-lived elves, marriage is much less of an institution as it is among other peoples.",
											"Wasps are iconic to Calistria, as widely recognized as a symbol of the faith as her formal religious symbol. Like the goddess, a wasp inflicts extreme pain in retribution for an offense, far beyond what it seems a simple insect ought to be capable of. Further cementing the similarity is the fact that the wasp seems to take a perverse pleasure in its attacks, pursuing offenders and stinging repeatedly. Many followers of Calistria carry yellow-and-black tokens on their person as a form of homage. Priests are known to cultivate giant wasp allies and pets, and many Calistrian gathering places harbor swarms of wasps under the eaves or in similarly sheltered spots. These swarms tend to ignore worshippers but descend in force upon any interlopers, defending such locations with even greater spite than expected from a typical wasp."

											"Once a mortal human, Cayden Cailean is now one the few deities known as the Ascended. In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden's attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.",
											"Cayden has no formal churches or structured clergy, but simple shrines to him appear in almost every tavern and roadside inn. Many of his priests own such businesses and offer healing to patrons, some of whom may have been injured during a drunken brawl. While Cayden's faith is a charitable one, Caydenites still seek payment for such services\u2014at the very least, the injured party is expected to purchase a round of drinks for the house. Only in places where worshippers of the Accidental God are in direct opposition to the local powers, such as where a rebellion is forming under a tyrant's nose, is his church out of the public eye. Caydenites can bring themselves to be quiet in the face of oppression only for so long, however, and once a rebellion reaches full bloom, the god's silver tankard is often proudly displayed across every bar.",
											"As a mortal, Cayden often found himself at odds with the work he was hired to perform and abandoned jobs that went against his conscience. This gave him a reputation for being unreliable among his more unscrupulous employers, but it garnered significant respect from clients with stronger morals. Legends tell of him taking contracts to free entire crews of slaves, undoing the operations of predatory business owners, and other rebellious deeds for the good of the common folk. His worshippers often involve themselves in similar matters: safeguarding the freedom and prosperity of working-class people, overthrowing tyrants, and helping the oppressed relocate to freer lands. His champions, in particular, embed themselves in nations with harsh laws and stir up rebellions\u2014often from the back room of a tavern.",
											"Members of Cayden's faith also maintain many orphanages in urban areas, arranging them to receive funding from local pubs and other Cayden-friendly establishments. Not much is known about Cayden's childhood as a mortal, but given his patronage of such houses, many have inferred that he spent at least some time in an orphanage when he was young. While the children in such orphanages are not expressly raised in the faith, most adopt the god's teachings when they grow old enough to leave. These individuals often take the surname Cailean to honor him, adding to the number of gregarious rebels in the world.",
											"While the consumption of alcohol is central to most of Cayden's worship, drinking to excess and dependency on drink are seen as misuse of the Accidental God's gifts. Clergy who develop such an addiction are encouraged by their community to take a large role in the faith's other works, such as maintaining orphanages or supporting rebel efforts, and those who recover often work to assist others with their own recovery from alcoholism. Though being the god of alcohol is a popular aspect of Cayden Cailean, members of his faith often find personal freedom and rejection of tyranny just as appealing as a strong drink, and it is not uncommon for teetotalers to number among Cayden's followers.",
											"Cayden is not particular about who worships him, so long as they abide by the simple expectations of freedom, bravery, and enjoying a good drink. As such, he has followers from almost all ancestries. A good number of his worshippers are half-orcs, who find the casual tenets and welcoming nature of the faith to be a good fit for those who have been ostracized from more stringent communities. His followers are typically good natured, boisterous, and optimistic. Life simply holds too much to take in for anyone to spend it gloomy. Many adventurers find Cayden's tenets to be a natural fit, taking jobs when they can and bucking cruelty wherever they find it."

											"The night didn't know beauty until Desna came into existence. While the other gods toiled away to create the world, she set her sights on the heavens, placing each star in the sky. After surveying her artistry, she hung the brightest star high in the north and made it her home. Her first gift to mortals was this beacon of hope, a twinkling sign in the dark sky that they could turn to when lost or unsure of themselves. Desna provides safe passage through the darkness to all, should they choose to follow.",
											"Desna journeys without end, for the wonders of the universe are endless. She relies on instinct to guide her, paying no mind to planning or destination. Her lapsing attention may come off as uncaring or cold, but Desna simply prefers an untethered, carefree existence. Her confidence in herself and her followers frees her from the indulgence of worry. She knows fate can always be rewritten and encourages others to embrace all that life has to offer. Desna wants her followers to take chances, get messy, and live life to its fullest. Those who follow her teachings she rewards with a spot of luck\u2014revealing unseen shortcuts, dangers to be circumvented, and undiscovered wonders.",
											"Desna is an ancient being, born during the dawn of time, but her sense of wonder has never faded. Even so, she is no stranger to hardship, understanding that fate can be cruel and love can be lost. This only strengthens her resolve. She believes in good luck, and that people can make their own fortune in life. To Desna, no one is ever truly lost; they need only find their way back to the path. She revels in mystery, being herself somewhat of an enigma, but she can always be found on the side of hope. Light always pierces the darkness, and all nightmares eventually give way to dreams.",
											"The goddess loves music and live performances. Legends say Desna played the world's first song by ringing the stars to celebrate the gods' completion of the material world. Her faithful have embraced her love of music and the arts and are often performers themselves, with many modern songs and dances having their roots in Desnan worship. Artists devoted to Desna have created some of the most famous poems and ballads on Gods of the Inner Sea and often perform in conjunction with Shelynites. A sizable portion of Desna's priesthood are bards, spreading her songs across the world on their travels.",
											"Desna encourages her followers to chase their bliss, find what impassions them, and explore. She recognizes love in all its forms and remains committed to her lovers Sarenrae and Shelyn. She also shares a close relationship with Cayden Cailean and has no reservations about taking on new lovers. Desna is protective of those she cares for and does not hesitate to strike back at any who would hurt or impede those she has placed under her protection.",
											"When making a rare appearance to mortals, Desna appears as a beautiful woman with long dark hair and shining stars in her eyes. Brilliant, colorful patterns of pinks, purples, and blues trail behind her like a comet's tail as her majestic butterfly wings fly her through the cosmos. If she wishes to make her desires known, she imparts wondrous dreams to her followers, allowing them the rare opportunity to dance among the stars with her.",
											"There is little sense of authority within the Desnan church, though on Gods of the Inner Sea it is a faith that dates as far back as ancient Azlant. The church lacks any sort of hierarchy, and priests are valued by the tales of the journeys they've undertaken and the experiences they've had rather than for any seniority. A typical Desnan service is performed almost entirely in song, with interludes of dance, storytelling, and dream recollection interspersed throughout.",
											"Most centers of worship for Desna are not ornate temples but instead small, unattended shrines. These shrines are most commonly found at crossroads, remote areas of beauty, or the tops of hills where the stars can be viewed unimpeded. Traveling Desnan priests clean and maintain these shrines as they encounter them, leaving their signatures behind as a way of marking their own journey."

									"Desna is one of the oldest gods, and the earliest Mwangi religious traditions pair Desna, Queen of the Sky, with Curchanus, the Beast-God of the woods and wild places. Though these traditions differ on whether Desna and Curchanus were lovers or friends, they agree that, from her position in the heavens, Desna pined for Curchanus's wild freedom to explore the world's surface as he wished.",
									"When Lamashtu trapped and killed Curchanus to gain his dominion over beasts, the dying god imparted to Desna his power over travel. Desna used this newfound freedom to retreat even further into the sky, and into the dreams of her devoted. She is now known as the patron of the stars in the night sky, especially those that are hard to see because they are so distant, and she delivers pleasant dreams to those who also honor their friends and long to travel far. She is kind and benevolent, but roused to anger when her faithful or her friends are threatened, and she offers no quarter for followers of Lamashtu.",
									"In the Mwangi Expanse, Desna is most often associated with a pale blue color, a relic of her former role as Queen of the Sky. The Bonuwat consider Desna one-half of the pair known as Shimye-Magalla, alongside of Gozreh, as the sky and the wind are so intertwined as to be inseparable."

											"Unlike many other good deities, Erastil does not send his followers out into the world to fight and crush evil. Eschewing crusades and other ventures that take his followers away from their homes, Erastil watches over those who devote their lives to family and community. He is primarily an agricultural deity, specifically focusing on those aspects of nature that either can be tamed or are of use to his followers. His domain encompasses the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their everyday lives. While he is a protective deity, Erastil steps in only when quiet, pastoral lives are threatened. He desires his followers to live their lives in peace, with no risk of being conscripted into armies, devoured by monsters, or destroyed by magic.",
											"Family is of vital importance to the Elk Father. He places a high value on marriage and children, considering caring for a spouse and family to be one of the most important tasks in life. Erastil's communities advocate for the unmarried to wed as soon as possible, though they never force a marriage for the sake of tying the knot. Widows and widowers often remarry, especially if they are caring for children. Erastil frowns upon adultery and anything else that bends or breaks the bonds of marriage, such as a union built on lies. However, he understands when a marriage has been sullied by the likes of abuse and supports separation when it encourages the safety of an individual and community.",
											"Erastil sees building families as a goal for all people. Those who cannot bear children should still be ready to take in those who need a family, and his followers encourage those who remain single to act as surrogate parents and role models for children. He values traditions that build families, even when they are viewed as quaint by others, but he is willing to accept new traditions as long as they strengthen families rather than weakening them. The Elk Father is known to be slow to adapt to change, often trying to fit foreign ideas into a familiar framework, but he always supports strong relationships rather than rejecting them\u2014he thus accepts all manner of matrimony and family, so long as they are supportive of their respective communities.",
											"Erastil is thought by most to have his own family, but he rarely speaks of them to his followers or involves them directly in his faith. The Elk Father wishes to avoid worshippers becoming distracted by their god's relationships\u2014mortals should view their own families, whatever their makeup, as sacred, rather than focus on the family of a god simply because it is divine.",
											"When granting gifts, Erastil prefers practical boons over flashier miracles. Many believe he is the deity who originally gifted mortals the bow so they could hunt for sustenance\u2014but not for pleasure. He teaches farmers how to know when to sow and reap; ranchers how to tell when livestock are sick, lame, or gravid; and both how to heal humans and animals. His values are those of a slow-paced, pastoral life, one in which his followers respect and are sustained by the gifts of nature. He also teaches cooperation, and his priests are often the first to arrive at a barn-raising or house-building. Their sermons are as likely to be lessons in how to spot corn blight as anything philosophical.",
											"The vast majority of Erastilian priests are clerics, with a few druids and the occasional ranger. Champions of Erastil exist but are far less common than those of Torag or Iomedae. Although priests of Erastil act as leaders of the faith as the community requires, they live among the communities they serve and might be established artisans, farmers, or hunters in their own right. They support the community, often by providing healing services to livestock as well as people, blessing crops, and assisting with trade. Priests of Erastil are expected to marry, though it is not a requirement; many priests see their entire community as their family and a sacred commitment.",
											"Erastilian worship services are short and to the point, with sacred music designed to be sung and played while working. His temples, like his priests, serve multiple duties. In addition to being used for worship, these simple buildings serve as a general gathering place and a space to engage in crafts that require a lot of space and a roof. Erastil's major festival, Archerday, is celebrated with archery competitions, feasting, and often proposals of marriage.",
											"Erastil generally appears as a tall humanoid man with the head of an elk, clad in traditional hunter trappings and holding a bow, though he sometimes instead appears as a trapper of the particular follower's ancestry. This is especially common when he makes himself known to children or lost travelers, to help them remain at ease. All hooved animals are associated with Erastil, and elk are particularly sacred to his faith\u2014though he still allows hunting of these creatures, so long they are hunted out of necessity and with respect.",
											"Adventurers rarely worship Erastil, as he tends to attract those who prefer to stay home and concern themselves with their community and family. Those who do serve him tend to adventure for the good of their community; they may attempt to determine the cause of monster attacks on their settlement, earn money for something the villagers need and can't build themselves, or gain knowledge that is of use to their people."

											"The clash of steel, the cry of victory, the gasping denial of death: these are the sound of prayers to Our Lord in Iron, for to follow Gorum is to fight. Gorum does not care the reason for battle\u2014a village's desperate stand against raiders is no less worthwhile to him than a crusader army marching against demons in the Sarkoris Scar\u2014nor does he choose sides in such clashes. Good or evil, law or chaos, the reason for the fight is irrelevant. It is the thrill of battle that finds his favor, the crucible of struggle in which victory is there for the taking.",
											"Gorum recognizes the value of strategic warfare and the need for archery, siege weapons, and stealth, but those hold little allure for him compared to hand-to-hand combat, the contest of raw, brute strength against honed, deadly skill. Gorum takes no pleasure in one-sided fights or the slaughter of innocents; an armored knight drawing a sword in his name against a helpless peasant might find his blade rust away. Far more delightful would be the peasant's seemingly pointless swing of an iron pot, which might be answered as if it were a spoken prayer and transformed into a deadly blow.",
											"The god's followers hold that one is either brave or a coward, with battle the threshing floor that separates the wheat from the chaff. Death in battle is an honor. While tactical retreats or even breaks in fighting to negotiate are tolerable, no greater shame can befall a person than to flee from combat. Murder and assassination similarly offer no honor, and Gorum feels nothing but contempt for those practices, as well as for Achaekek and Norgorber, who condone them. The god and his followers likewise look on Urgathoa with disdain, as her diseases steal lives in the sickbed while the gluttony she promotes destroys warriors' fitness for meaningful battle.",
											"Gorum's followers are innumerable: soldiers, mercenaries, knights, and raiders across the Inner Sea region offer him tribute, especially in places where battle is an everyday way of life, such as Belkzen, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Gravelands. Believers claim that the god's spirit lives in iron and gird themselves in metal armor whenever possible. They fight frequently, though not always, to the death\u2014battle can establish dominance, relieve tension, or even just serve as prayer.",
											"His priests are hard to differentiate from his other followers. They commonly wear armor (or heavy robes that incorporate metal) as their vestments and are adorned with all manner of weapons, making them walking arsenals ready to draw steel at the slightest opportunity. Though Gorum has no sacred text, his followers learn the church's creed from a collection of seven heroic poems called the Gorumskagat. Each verse keeps to a rhythm that remains the same across all translations, which warriors learn to recognize and chant while on the march. These chants harmonize into the haunting sound of a roaring battle, and Gorumite warbands take great pride in chants that suggest great conflicts. Battle is the true language of Gorum, acting as the great unifier, and it differs little whether fought by those speaking Shoanti or Dwarven.",
											"Gorum's clerics preach that should all battle ever end, Gorum would abandon Gods of the Inner Sea, only to return when mortals inevitably clash again. His most holy sites are battlefields, consecrated by the struggles, blood, and lives of those fighting on them. His temples resemble fortresses, complete with armories and forges\u2014even those in the midst of peaceful cities. They contain images of the god, often pictured as a suit of spiked plate armor with burning red eyes. Shrines to him are simple: a pile of stones capped with a metal helm or a blade jammed into a crevice.",
											"Among adventurers, most Gorumites are humans or half-orcs, though followers can be found among all ancestries. They are valued companions thanks to their skill at defeating foes, even though violence tends to be their first answer to every problem. They typically set out not in search of great treasures but rather to find challenges, test their mettle, and honor their god in glorious combat. The most fortunate prove themselves by emerging from battle victorious time and time again, but even these are more likely to be slain on the battlefield than to retire and fade away into old age."

											"A timeless entity birthed from the first wind to stir the vast oceans, Gozreh wanders the world in the air and the seas. Sailors drop boxes of cargo as offerings to avoid a fatal storm, hoping to please the Wind and the Waves, even though they know that such pleas are far more likely to go unnoticed as they are to draw their deity's attention. The deity's temperament is fickle and their fury swift, hurling bolts of lightning and dragging to the crushing depths those who dare befoul the natural world. Gozreh is the sea that encapsulates the land and the wind that moves its surface, the birds that traverse the sky and the clouds that shield them.",
											"Gozreh is a deity of two aspects, depicted in art as one, the other, or both, depending on where the piece is featured. When coming from the ocean, she is shown as a woman with hair made of sea-foam rising waist-high from the waves. Over land and from the sky, he is drawn as an old man with a long beard, flecked black and gray by storm clouds with eyes of lightning. When depicted together, such as along shorelines, the two are portrayed reaching towards each other, their fingers separated by the smallest of margins. Yet these aspects are not separate: they represent the Wind and the Waves, but the deity is both of them and also neither, for they transcend the mortal concepts of gender and body.",
											"Much like the winds and seas, Gozreh is temperamental and prone to sudden outbursts of wrath. They see all, flitting from the north breeze to the eyes of a starling to the roots of a mighty oak on the other side of the world. Those who pollute nature or destroy the unspoiled wilds might feel a sudden storm of Gozreh's wrath descending upon them, but such fits are unpredictable and indiscriminate, sometimes striking years later and upturning the lives of nearby innocents with no tie to the original trespass. While Gozreh is volatile, they are not malicious. Their rage ceases as quickly as it begins, leaving the sky and waters calm again. The Wind and the Waves sees and feels everything at once, and they do not have the luxury of remaining focused on a single act of desecration for long.",
											"Gozreh is a worldly deity, their interest focused on the weather and living things. Land has little meaning to them, save that the soil gives foundation to trees and fire clears the way for new life. Such things are not reviled by Gozreh's faith; they are simply considered unimportant on their own. Creatures likewise exist and then they fade, ceding their energy to what comes after. The Wind and the Waves cares more for the wilds, unspoiled by mortals and free to ebb and flow as it sees fit.",
											"Gozreh's clergy and followers represent a wide variety of gender identities. The deity's dual nature resonates with these worshippers, and the faith accepts all identities as part of the natural order. The church doesn't place an emphasis on marriage in particular, and seasonal trysts are equally as common among worshippers as unions that last for life. Members of some of the more secluded sects of the faith remain celibate and isolated, residing in the most remote mountains or shoreline caves and reflecting on Gozreh's independence from relationships\u2014after all, as a deity of dual natures, Gozreh is never truly alone.",
											"Most of Gozreh's followers wear their hair long\u2014sometimes all the way to the ground\u2014and weave seaweed, coral, or shells into it in intricate patterns. Clergy who can do so grow their beards long, often braiding them into tangled tresses. It is not uncommon for Gozran priests to grow their beards or hair to provide nesting material for small, local creatures, matting their hair over several months before cutting this hair to create small nests. Only the occasional priest houses small birds, frogs, or rodents in their hair while it is still attached.",
											"The most devout members of Gozreh's faith stay as far from civilization as possible, living deep in the woods or on barren coastal shores. Those who are more sociable often take positions on ships, where they serve as navigators and are seen as good luck charms who can help the ships avoid the fiercest of storms. These \"gale-speakers\" come ashore only to change to another vessel and are highly sought after by ship captains. Gale-speakers are not bought, however, choosing their own journeys and favoring vessels with far-flung destinations, waters rarely touched by anything but the Wind and the Waves."

									"Gozreh, the dualistic deity of storm and waves, has presented a study in contrasts since long before humanity's rise. Representing both waves and wind, male and female, old and young, Gozreh inspires those who study nature to see bounty and destruction in equal measure.",
									"In the Mwangi Expanse, Gozreh is often viewed as having one dominant aspect, although which aspect is dominant varies by region. In the Sodden Lands, fanatical Gozrens known as the Storm Kindlers see the Eye of Abendego, the ceaseless hurricane, as evidence of their god's destructive presence. They insist that growth and bounty cannot withstand the storm's lashing. The Bonuwat see Gozreh as embodying the freedom of the wind, and have long paired Gozreh with Desna as Shimye-Magalla, a powerful aspect of the open sky. Many priests in the central jungles venerate Gozreh as Rain-Bringer, whose restoring rains are vital to the jungle's survival and whose displeasure manifests equally as droughts or as destructive storms. No matter their form, Gozreh is never seen as a small god. Gozreh is always towering and impressive, whether as a hurricane, the winds that fill the sky, or rains that swell the rivers. The phrase \"Goz big\" means impossibly large, particularly when levied against someone whose aspirations seem unlikely."

											"Iomedae, the youngest among the prominent deities of the Inner Sea region, had already proven herself worthy of divinity before her ascension. Born in Cheliax, she followed the path of the sword and fought evil, eventually becoming a paladin of Aroden's herald Arazni. She became a legend among the Shining Crusade, leading the Knights of Ozem in a series of victories over the Whispering Tyrant. Iomedae became the third known mortal to pass the Test of the Starstone when she ascended to divinity in 3832 ar. As Arazni had been slain during the Shining Crusade, Aroden elevated the newly ascended goddess to be his new herald. When Aroden himself died, Iomedae inherited most of his worshippers and became a major deity of honor and justice.",
											"Iomedae's followers heed her call to take up arms against evil and fight wickedness for the majority of their lives. This may take the form of physical combat against the likes of fiends, undead, and other sinister creatures, but devotion to the Inheritor also manifests as individuals fighting against adversity, oppression, or injustice through their own personal methods. Wherever courage, righteousness, and valor are needed, Iomedae's followers thrive. Iomedae is popular among lawful good adventurers, and those who worship her sometimes show their faith by wearing a thin white chasuble over their normal adventuring gear.",
											"The Inheritor does not see herself as deity of war, but she places great value on prowess at arms and is patron to many military orders, and her saints are known for their combat skill. As the only woman who has ascended to divinity through the Test of the Starstone, she offers a haven for women fleeing from cruel partners, slave masters, and other oppressors. Many of these women grow to become skilled knights in their own right or earn positions of great influence within her church.",
											"Iomedae's favored weapon is the longsword, and while it is not required of them, many of her priests and champions refuse to use any other weapon. In fact, swords are so important to her faith that they are engraved on the wedding rings of the faithful, and the dead are buried with small sword tokens or even just a scrap of paper marked with a sword. They eschew the practice of burying an actual sword with the dead, however; swords are instead passed down to a family member or a student who has need of them, or are donated to a temple for use by priests and holy knights. The only exception is when a sword has become damaged beyond repair or where magic or some other influence keeps the sword tied to its wielder. Even in these cases, such swords have a habit of turning up in moments of great need, as if Iomedae herself charged it with continuing its duties. Armor is of similar importance to Iomedaeans, and they are rarely buried in their armor. Many bequeath suits of armor to loved ones so they can continue to serve Iomedae's cause.",
											"Priests of Iomedae often travel, usually with a circle: a group of 10 to 50 individuals under the charge of a sword knight. Many priests serve on the front lines of battle, directly combating evils themselves or aiding others who share their cause. Priests in cities keep their ears tuned for crime and work to stamp it out. Those who can't endure the rigors of battle or choose a more peaceful path often work in courtrooms, serve as advisors to nobles and local leaders, or train the next generation of crusaders. Iomedae's churches are rarely staffed directly by champions, clerics, or priests, as most prefer to remain active in their work. Instead, layfolk and acolytes serve at most churches within cities, though some crusaders become the wards of shrines and temples in more remote regions.",
											"Iomedae's holy days include Ascendance Day, which marks the day she passed the Test of the Starstone; Inheritor's Ascendance, which marks the day she became Aroden's herald; the Day of the Inheritor, which marks her assumption of Aroden's mantle; Remembrance Moon, a holiday commemorating the fallen in the Shining Crusade against the Whispering Tyrant; and Armasse, an ancient festival that includes jousts, duels, and other tests of arms. She also upholds the day of Mourningfell, where those who remember Arazni solemnly mourn her death at Tar-Baphon's hands. Much of her faith surrounds a document called the Acts of Iomedae, which details 11 miracles she performed as a mortal paladin. Iomedae manifests as a resplendent knight in shining armor. As she was born in Cheliax, she appears as a woman of Taldan ethnicity, fully armed and ready for battle."

Cursing someone so that Irori forgets them implies a wish that they did not exist and is particularly hurtful among friends or family. A variant, \"May Irori forget this,\" is commonly uttered after an uncommonly embarrassing or farcical event.}",

											"Irori exemplifies the concepts of self-perfection. His dogma states that he was a mortal who gained godhood through achieving a physical and mental state that surpassed mortal limitations. His followers seek to emulate their god's divine state by perfecting themselves using the words of the Unbinding of Fetters, Irori's sacred text. The illuminated pages of the tome detail numerous physical, spiritual, and mental exercises, as well as methods of learning and remembering.",
											"In addition to self-perfection, Irori is the god of history and knowledge, perfectly knowing the universe around him. He encourages his followers to follow suit and learn all they can about the world and what lies beyond. Even though Irori perfected himself, he is also a patient and kind teacher. He and his clergy allow each student to learn in a way that fits them by offering a multitude of practices and methods.",
											"As the Master of Masters, Irori teaches that a person is composed of a unified body, mind, and spirit. When one masters all three aspects of themselves as one, they see the Triune Self. To most mortals, the body and mind are more easily known than the spirit, so study begins there. Success gained from mastering the body and mind is then used to penetrate the secrets of the spirit and attain enlightenment. The search for perfection leads many followers to the priesthood, where they wander as solitary monks or dwell in secluded monasteries in endless practice. Many of these monasteries are sprawling complexes closed to the general public. The faithful pray, sleep, exercise, and study in their seemingly endless quest of perfection and purity, often taking vows of poverty and silence. Other temple complexes provide guidance and training to visitors in exchange for tithes and donations. Some of Irori's worshippers instead wander alone, strengthening their connection to Irori by giving up the distraction of material goods and living in caves, forests, or even graveyards. These ascetics may go naked or wear rags, and locals often believe they have mystical abilities. Despite their appearance, these worshippers are well respected among Iroran faithful.",
											"It is said that enlightened members of Irori's clergy are so self-aware they know when the hour of their death approaches. In preparation for this moment, some faithful ingest a diet of poisonous teas and nuts to perform self-mummification. This ritual allows them to watch over their monasteries after death and come to the aid of the faithful if necessary. Others, particularly those considered the most devout, seemingly disappear from the mortal world. These supposedly handpicked individuals are said to \"walk with the Master,\" becoming divine servants of Irori.",
											"In addition to a priest's search for self-perfection, the clergy of Irori still live and participate in worldly cycles. Monk-priests often act as historians and chroniclers for a region, and the libraries of Iroran monasteries house ancient and occult knowledge, making them popular among bards and sages. Elder clergy take this role to heart, gathering and storing knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Irori espouses that all knowledge is worth knowing and cares not for how it is used, except when it would create a loss of self-control. This seeming indifference to good or evil can put Irori's faithful at odds with more dogmatic churches.",
											"When ministering to layfolk, priests of Irori act as guides and shepherds, nudging worshippers to improve themselves. Some worshippers focus on one or two aspects of Irori's teachings and methods to become great unarmed warriors and gladiators, while others study medicine and philosophy exclusively. Even others study the history of the world or a given kingdom or region.",
											"Because of Irori's perfect nature, his followers tend not to depict him in art, believing that any depiction of the Master of Masters would pale in comparison to his actual appearance. Instead they use song and poetry to praise the indescribable flawlessness of their god. They describe him as a Vudrani man with dark skin, clad in simple robes and wooden shoes. Long hair worn in a simple braid sprouts from his otherwise bald head, the braid often wrapped around his neck as a necklace."

The Mother of Monsters readily accepts mortals into her fold and has made it her goal to twist mortal life toward her abhorrent ideals. Her intervention is widely known to inflict corruptions and terrible nightmares. Ostracized individuals who share her ideals will find this intervention a boon, while others treat similar events as horrible curses. Above all else, Lamashtu desires the proliferation, permeation, and dominance of her children. Her touch upon the mortal world reveals the repugnant flaws among those considered to be beautiful and moral. She and her followers seek opportunities to rip the veil of innocence from every creature and reveal the writhing, heinous potential in a hypocritical world.",
											"Lamashtu takes the form of a pregnant woman with scars crossing her swollen belly. Great black wings protrude from her back, and her legs contort into enormous avian talons. A third eye is vertically set above her jackal snout. From Kurnugia, her personal realm in the Abyss, she reigns as the Queen of Demons and creator of heinous beasts. Her children, either burst from her body or sculpted from her monstrous mind, serve as pinnacles of might among her followers. Her faithful pursue her ideals to become or create ever more vile monsters and spread her murderous influence over the mortal realm.",
											"Lamashtu encourages her worshippers to embrace monstrosity and may assist in this endeavor by granting torturous nightmares to unlock their minds to the might and truth she offers. Their corrupted imaginations fabricate ever more horrendous images for Lamashtu to introduce into reality. Devotees sacrifice the flesh and bone of conquered beasts and their enemies to provide building material for their mother to mold new monstrous brethren or to grant the gift of mutation to her faithful.",
											"Child-bearing followers are able to directly imitate some of their goddess's abilities. Bearing monstrous children for Lamashtu is regarded as one of the most sacred acts achievable within her religion. The mental and physical torment these worshippers experience during their Lamashtan pregnancies and the gruesome births they endure are sacrifices that earn them great prestige\u2014should they survive. Worshippers with the durability to survive several births, and who proudly bear the scars from them, are honored by other Lamashtans and reign as the utmost authority in the faith.",
											"Lamashtans spread their goddess's doctrine via a variety of paths. Warriors protect the brood alongside their monstrous siblings. Healers focus on keeping followers alive through multiple births and are talented in ensuring wounds form atrocious scars. Caretakers with the strength to manage the church's monstrous children are rewarded with blessings by the goddess to aid them in their duties. Worshippers of all kinds are likely to venture into the world as missionaries, recruiting shunned individuals and forsaken communities to benefit the prosperity of the brood.",
											"When those not among Lamashtu's faithful feel her presence, it is an omen of unimaginable misfortune. Communities subjugated by monsters and demons may find themselves pleading with Lamashtu to spare them from her children's wrath. Expectant parents who wake in the night from traumatizing nightmares fear what horrors their offspring may bring.",
											"Lamashtu's obsessive creation of new monsters promises to reshape the mortal world into a sinister menagerie of vile corruptors. Her devotees join a family of all manner of demons and beasts with the goal to cultivate and glorify the loathsome. To the world that ostracizes them, Lamashtans offer this ultimatum: join the brood, or perish under its might."

									"Lamashtu's influence in the Mwangi Expanse is not strong, but she has made her mark in many horrible ways. The Mother of Monsters is known in the Mwangi Expanse as the Howler or the Child-Eater, a predatory beast that steals away the young from inattentive parents. Although jackals and other cunning canines are her hungry offspring, she also manifests as poxes that kill or disfigure the young. When animals become disobedient or aggressive, it is a sign of Lamashtu's wicked influence, and keeping children away from such animals is wise from both practical and religious perspectives.",
									"Lamashtu's greatest mark upon the Mwangi Expanse was the murder of Curchanus, god of the beasts and wild places who held the Expanse in special favor. Curchanus could turn the heart of any wild animal as he chose, and Lamashtu coveted this power to assert her dominion over beasts and make the jungle a place of nightmare. Curchanus blunted Lamashtu's victory by giving his freedom of travel to Desna; Lamashtu gained Curchanus's authority over wild animals, but her animals would skulk and hide, and not roam far. Lamashtu's dominion was further eroded by animalistic deities such as Angazhan, who asserted control over aggressive beasts and apes.",

It signifies that just because an idea or entity is not currently understood or doesn't currently exist doesn't mean that it can't be understood, and often spurs the pursuit of understanding. That which is not immediately seen can still be learned from and uncovered, often granting new insight.}",

At a base level, it directs followers toward a challenge that allows them to learn, while at the same time warning that the challenge could be destructive.}"

											"To some, magic is a powerful weapon. To others, it's a malleable tool. And to a few, it's a source of purpose. With an understanding of spellcasting, creatures can cause fire to erupt from their hands, call otherworldly beings to aid them, bewitch the senses, and even bring the dead back to life. The ability to reshape reality to better suit one's needs and desires is a powerful call that most only dream of being able to answer, and few are ever able to truly master such might.",
											"One such master was Nethys, who was revered as a god-king in ancient Osirion. Having sought to unlock all of the secrets and potential held within the planes and beyond, Nethys shattered his own mind from the sheer overload of knowledge to which he was exposed. Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body. One seeks to destroy the world, to purge it through fire and ruin, and to conquer all that exists. The other attempts to protect the world, to elevate and educate, and to release it from its limits.",
											"Those who encounter Nethys typically describe him as unpredictable. His shifts in mood and outlook, which occur without reason, often make interactions with him strained. Yet despite the difficulties, he teaches those who seek him out, regardless of their intent. So long as they strive to use magic, to explore its limitless potential, they can earn Nethys' patronage. From the vilest curses to the purest remedies, magic and its continued use seem to be the only drive Nethys maintains. This is often reflected in his followers, who may seek to uncover all they can about the arcane by crafting new uses for existing spells, or to simplify mundane tasks through magical means. Using magic whenever possible is an often-practiced tenet of Nethys's followers. Some of the more zealous followers take it to the fullest extent, opting to use magic for doing all their household tasks at once, utilizing only magical sources of light, or constantly providing themselves with a light breeze.",
											"Nethys's worshippers seek to gain greater knowledge and expand upon their powers. While the majority of his faithful welcome those who seek to learn and understand magic, a fair portion actively shun those without the talent or patience for it. Many followers push for others to learn, often withholding the full answers to questions and offering just enough information to lead others to seek out the answers themselves and learn from their own pursuits. Some instead guard their knowledge jealously, hoping to ensure their own understanding far outpaces that of others who chase similar knowledge. It is common for the followers of Nethys to come off as aloof or indifferent, perhaps even mirroring the god of magic by attempting to balance the world around them, allowing disaster that could be prevented while bringing structure where it is lacking. Most refrain from politics, instead choosing to take impartial viewpoints that do not require taking hard stances, though a Nethysian's neutral stance makes them perfect advisors for rulers dealing with magic-related issues.",
											"Standalone temples constructed solely for the worship of Nethys are rare. Instead, many double as libraries and studies, and preexisting libraries and colleges often hold shrines to Nethys within. Most of these temples are grandiose edifices whose imposing nature suggest architecture only capable with the aid of magic. In fact, many of the caretakers of such sites take pride in the unique spells required in the creation of the more elaborate temples of Nethys. A few more remote locations hold small shrines to Nethys, often containing small traveling libraries along with various scraps of research that might spur those who stop and partake to pursue new knowledge, though such shrines are particularly rare. These shrines and their libraries are constructed by followers who actively roam the lands in search of new secrets. Priests of Nethys commonly wear contrasting colors, often one light and one dark, or take to painting or tattooing one half of their body to better represent the duality of the god of magic."

											"Norgorber is the most mysterious of the Ascended, the group of mortals who assumed godhood after passing the Test of the Starstone. Unlike Iomedae's and Cayden Cailean's mortal existences, Norgorber's life before his ascension is a mystery; the god himself has shrouded details of his mortal life in secrecy. This is no surprise to those familiar with Norgorber\u2014he is the master of all secrets, a calculating manipulator who cleverly and ruthlessly wields the power of hidden knowledge to achieve his own ends. Only his most trusted worshippers know enough about his goals to assist in the god's plans, and even those worshippers often have their memories modified after their parts in Norgorber's schemes are complete.",
											"In artwork, Norgorber is often portrayed merely by his religious symbol: a black, featureless mask. The god actively interferes in artists' attempts to realistically reproduce his likeness by causing blindness or tremors to prevent completion of their work. Those who claim to have seen him can describe only a nondescript hooded figure in black and gray, with his face lost in shadows.",
											"Norgorber is worshipped in four aspects, each of which embodies a facet of the god's sinister portfolio: Blackfingers, god of poison; Father Skinsaw, god of murder; the Gray Master, god of thieves; and the Reaper of Reputation, god of secrets. Norgorber's followers typically align themselves with one aspect above the others, though some temples venerate the god in all of his guises. Temples dedicated to different aspects of the god operate independently, though they might work together to accomplish complicated schemes planned by the god or his minions.",
											"{@b Blackfingers:} In his aspect as the god of alchemists and poisoners, Norgorber represents the covert use of dangerous substances to achieve personal gain and the pursuit of alchemical secrets regardless of the consequences. Even alchemists who worship more benevolent gods covet the secrets known by Blackfingers, though his worshippers would contend that nonbelievers are too cautious or kindhearted to successfully pursue Norgorber's forbidden techniques. Followers of Blackfingers are reckless experimenters, selectively breeding spiders or scorpions to develop stronger venoms or testing chemical tinctures on prisoners to study their effects. Their experiments often lead to the development of useful contraband, such as untraceable poisons that mimic the effects of disease or powerful acids that eat through locks or prison bars.",
											"{@b Father Skinsaw:} Bloodthirsty and brutally violent, Norgorber's Father Skinsaw aspect is worshipped by only the most heartless killers. Whether they're merciless bandits, cutthroat thieves, or fearsome butchers, followers of Father Skinsaw focus on snuffing out life, either as a show of dominance, a gruesome sacrament, or a celebration of depravity. While senseless killing is enough for many worshippers of Father Skinsaw, some serial killers see their crimes as steps in the unknowable plans of their dark god. For them, every murder is a prayer.}",
											"{@b The Gray Master:} Blackmail, extortion, larceny, kidnapping\u2014all of these are sacred to followers of the Gray Master. Norgorber's aspect as the god of thieves encourages his followers to seize what they can get and disregard moral compunctions and the law. While individual guilds of thieves might follow guidelines that ensure profitability or help them avoid authorities, those that follow the Gray Master seek to profit at the expense of others. Of all the god's aspects, the Gray Master is the most likely to have organized cults of followers, and his priests often hold important positions in thieves' guilds, gangs, and crime syndicates.",
											"{@b The Reaper of Reputation:} Politicians, spymasters, and even archivists or researchers might worship Norgorber as this, his least malevolent aspect. The Reaper of Reputation represents the power of information: the power of discovering it, the power of keeping it secret, and the power of whispering it in the right ear at the right time. While many good people are interested in gathering useful information, those who follow the Reaper of Reputation usually do so to further their own selfish ends and seek to leverage insider knowledge for personal gain. Price manipulation and political corruption are the trade of many of the Reaper of Reputation's followers, but his most extreme worshippers might ferret out a secret and then kill anyone who had learned of it, merely to keep its power for themselves."

											"No record of history, and not even other gods, can recall a time before Pharasma. Her throne lies within a vast, gothic cathedral located on the infinite Spire at the center of the planes. From here, she looks both forward and backward in time, observing the births, lives, and deaths of every soul, as she serves as the final arbiter of a soul's destination after death. Psychopomp servants of Pharasma guide and safeguard newly dead souls along the River of Souls to her realm, where she judges each soul and ensures it is sent to the proper plane for its afterlife, according to its alignment and mortal deeds. Although she can see all possible fates and knows the fate of each individual, free will and choice can alter a soul's final destination, and she places great weight on the individual's actions and personal choices. Therefore, Pharasma withholds her final judgment until a soul stands before her. Her prophecies are cryptic, and their full meanings are rarely revealed until the foretold events occur.",
											"Once Pharasma has judged a soul, it can no longer be returned from the dead by mortal magics such as raise dead or resurrect. While it may be within Pharasma's power to do so, she has never withheld a soul from its proper destination\u2014not even from the realms of gods she may despise. She embraces her role with a dispassionate dignity that often makes her seem aloof or uncaring, but in truth she simply understands the necessity of impartiality to sustain the cycle of life and balance throughout the planes. Almost all other deities show Pharasma great deference, for she is the only one they trust to unfailingly distribute souls to their proper planes.",
											"Pharasma abhors the creation of undead and magic that traps souls, preventing them from arriving in her realm for judgment and disrupting the balance of the cycle of souls. She commands her followers to destroy all such abominations and to release any bound souls.",
											"Pharasma is usually portrayed as a tall, ash-skinned woman with white eyes and wild, flowing, white hair, cloaked in dark robes and holding an hourglass filled with red sand. Many dread her as a grim reaper, ready to take their souls at the end of their mortal existences. Yet many also worship her as the guardian of birth and new souls, a wise scholar, and a healer. These worshippers call her The Mother of Souls, a title reflecting her protective and guiding nature. Pharasma's religious symbol depicts a silver-and-blue spiraling comet, which signifies the bright and winding path of every soul's potential.",
											"While her faithful most often wear black clothing trimmed in purple or silver during rituals, they are also fond of wearing brilliant shades of silver, blue, and purple throughout their daily lives and during sacred rites celebrating birth and life. Midwives and physicians carry silver religious symbols of Pharasma on long chains when they go to bless newborn children or say prayers over the dying. Scholars and oracles embroider Pharasma's spiral or an hourglass to represent their belief in fate, prophecy, or observation of time. Those devout to Pharasma are generally circumspect when it comes to taking sides in politics or conflicts. Priests of Pharasma can frequently be found blessing, healing, and tending to the dead on rival sides of disputes, battles, and even wars with equal efficiency.",
											"Places of worship dedicated to Pharasma range from the simplistic to the ostentatious. Mausoleums and crypts usually contain at least a token idol or shrine dedicated to Pharasma. Shrines to her can be as simple as a carved stone on a river island or within a graveyard. However, Pharasma's temples are towering, gothic cathedrals decorated with stained glass and carved statuary. These temples typically have universities, hospitals, and immense libraries attached above ground, and vast, deep catacombs intricately decorated with the bones of the deceased below. Wealthy patrons and scholars pay membership fees to access knowledge and wisdom within her temples. Since being interred within the catacombs of Pharasma is deemed a blessing, they also contribute sizable donations to secure prominent locations for their bodies' later interment in the crypts, often as an attempt to gain favor during Pharasma's judgment of their soul in the afterlife. It is not uncommon for entire libraries or estates to be donated to the church of Pharasma from the deathbeds of the rich and powerful concerned with how their mortal deeds will reflect upon their immortal soul."

											"Rovagug has no single holy scripture. He has little use for one, for his sole commandment is to destroy, and his followers need no instruction in how to accomplish that. The figurative and literal monsters who worship Rovagug share their myths and legends in secret shrines and hidden caves, calling him the Rough Beast, the Imprisoned King, the Tide of Fangs, the Unmaker, and the Worldbreaker. They tell each other that each life they snuff out, each piece of art they destroy, each work of labor they bring tumbling down puts a crack in the prison that holds their god. Each of their little efforts of destruction adds up and will one day free him, setting him loose to bring about the end of all things.",
											"They tell of how Rovagug crawled millennia ago from beyond the depths of the universe, leaving only devastation in his wake. An endless number of lesser gods fell before him, devoured in his massive maw or crushed beneath his unholy bulk. His worshippers whisper in anger of a cowardly alliance of the other gods, who couldn't hope to stop him alone: While sly Calistria distracted the Rough Beast, foul Torag, weak Gorum, and judgmental Pharasma conspired to forge an unbreakable prison in the heart of Gods of the Inner Sea. Arrogant Sarenrae had the temerity to challenge Rovagug directly. She used holy fire to lure him close to the world that would be his prison before finally slicing a great rift on the surface that drew him in. Only then did cowardly, smug Asmodeus seal Rovagug in the Cage, taunting him with the Hell-forged key.",
											"Still, his worshippers say, this prison merely contains Rovagug, and only for now. He sleeps fitfully, his shudders causing the earth to tremble and mountains to fall, his cries of rage spewing noxious gases to poison his enemies' followers. His flesh births and sustains horrors undreamed of, parasites with the power to wreak destruction above. The deadliest of these\u2014great spawn such as Festering Ulunat, the Unholy First; Chemnosit, the Monarch Worm; Xotani, the Firebleeder; and Tarrasque, the Armageddon Engine\u2014are almost gods in their own rights, laying waste to Gods of the Inner Sea and leaving nothing but destruction in their wakes. They have caused catastrophes on a scale most of the Rough Beast's followers only dream of, monstrous steps toward setting Rovagug free to feast on the gods who locked him away.",
											"While most of Rovagug's followers simply seek an end to all, his most extreme worshippers believe they will be uplifted as gods in a new world Rovagug will create after destroying the old. In truth, the Rough Beast cares nothing for them. He cares only about destruction and bringing an end to all things. Should the day come that his prison fails, he would, after enacting his vengeance on the other gods, turn on his own spawn and followers, devouring them as surely as all else.",
											"Rovagug's faith is forbidden in civilized lands, where no temple to him is allowed to stand. The Rough Beast's worshippers revel in the hatred of the other gods and their faithful. Creatures who take up Rovagug's service live to destroy. Most are monsters or hail from communities that celebrate destruction; they cry out paeans to the god as they cut through lesser creatures in howling fits of rage. A few individuals\u2014all somewhat monstrous in their own right\u2014follow Rovagug in their lust for the power that they believe even the other gods fear, or in the mistaken belief that the obliteration the god promises would clear the way for a new birth. Even they know enough to not name their deity in the open, however, lest they be swiftly cut down.",
											"The few adventurers who follow Rovagug cherish destruction, laying waste to as much as they can. They may be warlords, cultists seeking to open the locks of Rovagug's prison, warriors who have seen such horrors that they can envision only destruction, or vengeful souls who want an end for themselves and all who have hurt them."

											"Sarenrae is one of the most popular deities on Gods of the Inner Sea by virtue of her association with the life-giving sun and her perpetual offer to help anyone be their best, even when they have made mistakes. Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun's power for everyone's safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit. Her followers aspire to emulate her through generosity, nurturing, truthfulness, and selfless courage. They oppose evil everywhere with words first, and when necessary, with scimitar and flame.",
											"Sarenrae is also much revered as a symbol of renewed hope, having selflessly led the charge against Rovagug to save Gods of the Inner Sea from utter destruction in the mythic past. It was she who cast Rovagug into his terrible tomb within the world and set the fire of the sun within his prison to weaken the Rough Beast and prevent his escape. She has the aspect of an angel, having originated as one of the mightiest angels before establishing herself as a true deity, and she resumes this aspect of a burning avenger when she encounters evil too entrenched for even her to redeem it.",
											"Sarenrae's holy text is {@i The Birth of Light and Truth}. It records her struggles as an angel before mortal history began and also offers guidance on resisting evils of convenience, standing against cruelty in the world, and teaching and redeeming an evil soul. Preachers often publicly cite the text in passionate sermons when condemning cruelty and corruption, giving the faithful a reputation as fiery zealots. In places like Qadira, this puts many of her followers in conflict with those in power who allow or even support evils like slavery\u2014in recent times, she has stripped her blessings from those among the faith who condoned such evils, though after the Dawnflower's temper cooled, she has publicly offered redemption to disgraced faithful who are willing to repent.",
											"The church of Sarenrae is devoted to healing all ills, nourishing body and spirit, and correcting evils. It is a flexible, quasi-familial organization that calls its members to go where they are needed. Most people recognize Sarenrae's bright, soaring temples, which allow services to be performed in direct sunlight. The largest tend to incorporate Keleshite architecture, as in many areas Sarenrae's faith spread ahead of Kelesh's economic expansion. Sarenite services are traditionally joyous, with singing and dancing. Milestones in familybuilding and personal growth are especially celebrated, including adoption, marriages, coming of age, and recognizing a former evildoer as rehabilitated.",
											"Clergy are called to do many kinds of good in the world. They feed the hungry, tend the ill, heal the injured, and guide the lost. Many are trained as diplomats and advisers in the hope of maintaining peace and ensuring that governments are just and merciful. They also counsel those with torn spirits, mediate disputes, and rehabilitate those who have wronged others. Although most day-to-day work of the church is peaceful, its members practice swordplay and magic both as a form of meditative art and as preparation to strike down irredeemable evil with merciful speed.",
											"Those who have done great wrongs but feel regret sometimes join Sarenrae's church because the goddess offers a chance at redemption even to people who have committed terrible evils. The reflective and intimate Candlemark holiday on the winter solstice\u2014celebrating the personal reasons that each individual follower joined the church\u2014has special significance to these followers, as well as new practitioners and those in trying times."

											"{@indentFirst {@b Love and beauty belong to all:} All beings are capable and worthy of love, even those who have been twisted or corrupted by such facets of love as jealousy or possessiveness. Love is a power that has the strength to redeem and unite, and it is as varied in meaning as all the creatures who feel it in their hearts.}",
											"{@indentFirst {@b Love is the greatest of all things:} Shelyn's greatest teaching is that love is the most powerful of all forces. It drives the actions of mortals and gods alike, and it endures beyond knowledge, language, and ambitions. Painful emotions such as anger or fear are echoes of a love that is missing, and therefore can be soothed only by love.}"

											"Shelyn watches over existence with a kind and loving eye, encouraging mortals to make the best of their lives by spreading love, art, and beauty as best they can. Even the crudest artistic awakenings are worthy of praise in the goddess's eyes, as they represent an individual's expression of life's trials and triumphs. She believes every creature is worthy of love and capable of creating art in their own way. Shelyn's religion does not require chastity, fidelity, or a particular relationship structure, as the passion of early romance is a facet of love just as important and valid as the comfortable trust between a long-married couple. However, she does make the distinction between courtship and pure carnal desire, and she prefers that trysts blossom into more meaningful relationships along the way.",
											"As the goddess of art and beauty, Shelyn's appearance changes drastically depending on the cultural norms of the artists who depict her. She has been portrayed as nearly every ancestry, though usually with some distinctive similarities: her ankle-length hair is marked with festive rainbow streaks and her eyes are blue, silver, both, or one of each color.",
											"Shelyn's mother is unknown, though some claim she was born of an ancient goddess of love. Shelyn's father was the spirit-wolf Thron, who roamed Gods of the Inner Sea in primordial times singing feral praises to love, life, and the universe. Though Thron had many partners and children, he had only two children who grew to surpass him in power: Shelyn and Dou-Bral. After a fight between the siblings, Dou-Bral rejected his divine responsibilities and disappeared beyond the edge of the Great Beyond. He eventually returned, but changed: possessed by some malevolent spirit and reshaped as the twisted and corrupted lord Zon-Kuthon. The two siblings clashed once more, this time coming to a truce only when Shelyn wrested her brother's gold-plated glaive, Whisperer of Souls, from his hands, believing it to be the source of his corruption. Though Zon -Kuthon remains evil, going so far as to mutilate and reshape his own father into a grotesque herald, Shelyn still believes that her brother exists somewhere beneath the corruption, and she hopes to one day redeem him.",
											"This tragic schism in Shelyn's family contributes to her belief that all creatures deserve love, and that even those who have turned to evil still carry love within them, along with the possibility of healing and redemption. While Zon-Kuthon, Asmodeus, Rovagug, and Urgathoa are sometimes considered enemies of her faith, in truth Shelyn doesn't look at any creature in a way that fits the mortal concept of \"enemy.\" Even evil deities and their faiths tend to look more kindly on Shelyn and her worshippers than they do the other good gods.",
											"While she is well aware that love and art are not easy things and can even be sources of pain at times, she remains a steadfast optimist with the knowledge that even broken hearts may be mended, and that even a turbulent experience with love can be an educational and healing journey. But she also recognizes that some creatures may distort love into jealousy or warp the urge to create into greed or obsession. While she appreciates passion and perseverance in the face of adversity, Shelyn never asks her followers to forsake the well-being of themselves or others to pine obsessively, aggressively pursue an uninterested person, or endanger themselves for art. It is equally important to her followers to spread love as it is to correct those who would use Shelyn's name to justify selfish, covetous, or cruel deeds.",
											"Shelynites gather at her temples on the holy day of Crystalhue, a winter celebration full of creation, friendly gatherings, and courtship. Many couples get engaged or married on Crystalhue, and the temples host grand feasts in the evening for the whole community to gather and enjoy food, company, and performances long into the night. No matter the season, Shelyn's temples are adorned with flowers, art, and images of her religious symbol: a songbird with vibrant rainbow tail feathers."

											"The head of the dwarven pantheon is the most visible of the dwarven deities, to the extent that Torag is the only dwarven deity most non-dwarves know of. While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag's areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deeprooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves' impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one's work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag's oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was longestablished even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation.",
											"Worship of Torag centers around the forge, literally and figuratively. Many sites of worship include an active forge, and crafting is incorporated into worship services. The god's teachings urge the faithful to continually practice and improve their artistry, regardless of their specific craft. Though metalworking is the most iconic skill, Toragdans also appreciate and encourage masonry, leatherworking, gem cutting, cooking, brewing, and virtually every other pragmatic craft. Refining one's techniques and improving skills are highly valued among Torag's followers, and this pursuit of quality and betterment is an aspect that draws many non-dwarves to the faith.",
											"A forge means nothing without the community around it, and as a result, Torag's followers hold family, friends, and the wider society to be of utmost importance. This aspect of Torag's faith has attracted the worship of no small number of non-dwarves seeking a faith that focuses on bettering or protecting one's own society.",
											"It comes as no surprise that Torag places a strong emphasis on defense and combat prowess in the name of protecting one's community. Followers of Torag are expected to train in martial techniques and lead in the defense of the home\u2014including, with no reservations, offense against the community's enemies. Even so, the emphasis remains on protection, and Torag's focus on the use of military might for defense rather than conquest and glory is a key component in dwarves' tendency to remain ensconced in their fortresses and existing territories rather than expanding their borders.",
											"Torag encourages his followers to develop their skills in tactics, planning, and forethought, but he also supports the ability to think on one's feet and respond in the moment to the chaos of combat. Tales of the god's exploits in battle tell of his calm and collected demeanor, rarely losing his temper\u2014a temperament that his worshippers seek to emulate.",
											"Torag's church celebrates family events, such as marriages, births of children, and deaths. Stability, tradition, and orthodoxy are ingrained in the church, with values conveyed through legend and storytelling. Clerics and priests are thus central pillars of a dwarven community. Dwarven champions of Torag thrive, typically as paladins serving at the forefront of a community's military operations, and these champions' merciless devastation of their community's enemies is a terrifying sight. Toragdans believe in destroying the community's enemies, lest showing mercy lead to further bloodshed down the line, which makes being a redeemer virtually impossible to the faithful of Torag. When a dwarven settlement needs to address a far-off challenge, it is often champions who take up the task. In areas with few dwarves, encounters with these roaming faithful are sometimes the only interactions non-dwarves have with followers of Torag."

											"The chosen of Urgathoa do not dread the flaws of mortal flesh, such as aging, disease, or even death, for so long as they indulge in excess above all else, their goddess offers eternal freedom from such fickle constraints. Urgathoa herself was once a mortal woman who challenged and rejected the tenets of deities whose followers expected mindless conformity, temperance, and restraint. Why would the gods craft Gods of the Inner Sea into a near -endless buffet abundant with pleasures of the body and mind if the living weren't destined to feast from it? Urgathoa so loved satiating her life's appetites that in death, she spat in the face of Pharasma's judgment, murdered the psychopomp assigned to aid her transition to the afterlife, and tore herself from the Boneyard with a feat of will that not only returned her to the Material Plane but also transformed her into the first divine undead creature.",
											"Urgathoa demands that her faithful reject moderation and self-restraint at all costs, instead urging reckless gluttony, constant experimentation, and the relentless pursuit of appetites of the flesh. Above all, Urgathoa's children must feed their endless hunger. They must dine from every great hall, striving to fully satiate their cravings as they feast, for every morsel bears a sacred truth gleaned only from its consumption. Her followers should taste the flesh and drink the lifeblood of other sapient creatures to discover what hidden thirsts their essence might quench. Only the weak fear to indulge those yearnings they mislabel as strange and taboo, for even poison can be savored as a sweet nectar upon the tongue if one is strong enough to relish its torment. Disease and infection are but tests of her followers' conviction and should be willingly contracted and endured, as Urgathoa reveals her most treasured secrets in the fevered dreams that often accompany these afflictions. Undeath\u2014seen by so many as a perversion of the mortal form\u2014is the ultimate transcendence beyond the body's limitations, for those who defy the hypocrisy of death's judgmental gaze shall never know an existence where their desires remain unfulfilled. Nowhere are these tenets of putting one's personal gratification and sensation first more espoused than in Urgathoa's holy text, {@i Serving Your Hunger}, written by the Pallid Princess's first champion, Dason.",
											"Much like the principles held by members of her church, Urgathoa's existence defies the natural order. She is often depicted as a raven-haired woman wielding an enormous scythe. Her upper torso is clad in skin as pale as a vampire's; her abdomen peels into rotted strips of flesh that expose her entrails; and her pelvis, legs, and feet are torn clean of muscle and flesh, revealing little more than bleached bone. Her clothes, if she wears any, are stained with blood and bile\u2014more often she wears nothing, in a mockery of the carnal form. Some say the footprints left from her first steps upon Gods of the Inner Sea filled with a pestilence so indomitable it has spawned thousands of other plagues as it evolves and adapts, leaving mortals incapable of developing an immunity to it. Others say the first words Urgathoa spoke after returning to the Material Plane stole the breath from the lungs of those who heard them, transforming these poor creatures into wraiths and specters that shared her endless hunger. The faithful hold that her touch can evoke pleasures so great that those who know her embrace never experience a desire for anything else ever again. And should Urgathoa ever bestow a curse upon an individual, her followers believe it can be removed only by gorging in excess on the raw flesh of sapient creatures.",
											"The church of Urgathoa is organized as a matriarchy. Usually, a powerful female cleric presides over each temple, leading a congregation composed mostly of necromancers, undead, or those hoping to eventually become undead. While most worshippers of Urgathoa concern themselves less with spreading her faith than increasing their own pleasure in her name, they often work together to ensure that her temples are devoted to offering experiences rife with pure sensation. Temples with more experienced clerics tend to offer services that can satisfy more peculiar, and often grotesque, hungers. Her faith is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region, though she is venerated openly in Geb.",
											"Senior clergy of Urgathoa sometimes practice a ritual known as the Reaping, in which they don clean gray robes and arm themselves with scythes before heading out into the surrounding countryside to deal as much death and destruction as they can upon worshippers of Urgathoa's most hated enemies. During the slaughter, each cleric attempts to inflict wounds that spatter as much blood and gore upon their garments as possible, believing that if Urgathoa is pleased by the results of the Reaping, she will grant a boon to each worshipper who participated. The blood-soaked robes from a successful Reaping are often displayed in temples of Urgathoa as symbols of the goddess's approval of the local clergy's efforts."

									"Ah, the Pallid Princess. According to legend, Urgathoa forged the immortal path many of us follow when she defied Pharasma and became the first undead. Ever since, she has guided others in their transformations. Rather than drift along the River of Souls, a spirit might veer back toward its old haunts or body with Urgathoa's divine presence guiding them as a lighthouse guides a ship. Thus, for most of my unliving charges, Urgathoa is the fearsome midwife who welcomes undead back into the world and receives their accolades forever after. Her priests replicate these efforts by dutifully ending lives, protecting undead, and aiding their eternal faithful. I welcome them.",
									"Granted, the Pallid Princess's faith has quite the flair for the dramatic. Bone altars and blood-soaked edifices prove... macabre, and I find little use in them. But Urgathoa's worshipers delight in such accouterments, as if these monuments validate their undead existence.",
									"Yet Urgathoa represents more. Her blasphemies against Pharasma seemingly rewrote reality, allowing undead to exist, almost like teaching gravity to fall in an unimagined new direction. Thus, those with necromantic talent can exploit these vulnerabilities within the multiverse to reshape the River of Souls, animating and controlling minions. To understand Urgathoa's achievements is to repurpose and reinterpret them through arcane will as I have.",
									"Our relationship is... complex. Arguably my own undead apotheosis wouldn't have been possible without Urgathoa's indirect contributions. Likewise, her faith's victories on Golarion wouldn't have happened without my leadership and arcane power. Yet neither of us is in the other's debt.

Imagine the idleness of ghouls and vampires if they lacked the need to feed. By her ghastly grace, my subjects are not simply tireless in body but restless in spirit, always driven toward new objectives that better my lands.",
											"Their hunger is usually less poetic. Living and undead, Urgathoans crave nearly any commodity in excess. Typically, this involves food and drink, luxurious or rotten as suits the individual in question. Yet potentially any appetite\u2014 provocatively wasteful performance art, sexual expression, and more\u2014might drive her faithful. While I permit those in Mechitar such grisly displays, rites to Urgathoa are discouraged abroad, and her followers must avoid undue attention. Yet even the most secretive priests can't help but conduct blood sacrifices occasionally or spread undeath throughout a town. Most cases of vigilantism against the Pallid Princess's faith immediately follow these indulgent outbursts.",
											"Strangely enough, Urgathoa's greatest strength is her poise. She encourages ravenous and reckless insatiability, yes, but she is the host of the figurative party, indulging her gluttony on her own terms and from a position of power, ever confident in her prestige and influence. It's this feasting without repercussion to which her avid followers aspire."

											"The Midnight Lord embodies and glorifies pain, shadows, and mutilation, and he is one of the most twisted and malevolent gods on the face of Gods of the Inner Sea. Once known as Dou-Bral, he crafted the immense Star Towers that still help keep Rovagug pinned in his prison at Gods of the Inner Sea's heart, lending his own skill and ability to the great deific alliance to bind that evil entity. Yet a divine argument between him and his sister Shelyn resulted in the god departing for parts unknown. Zon-Kuthon traveled beyond the edges of the multiverse and stared into the face of the incomprehensible things that dwell there. No one knows what he found in that place, but he returned\u2014changed, but claiming to be strengthened by what he had endured. Likewise, the nation of Nidal on Gods of the Inner Sea, which is bound to him, is a nation of survivors, founded by those few strong enough to do what they must so their people could survive the terrible aftermath of Earthfall and the Age of Darkness that followed.",
											"Zon-Kuthon teaches that torment is the ultimate pleasure and sacrament, and that inflicting and enduring pain is the truest strength. Experiencing pain and learning to embrace it allows one to purge the weakness of their body and spirit. After all, much of mortal creatures' fear is rooted in the struggle to avoid pain in one way or another. If a follower can learn to embrace that pain instead, the chains of fear fall away, becoming a tool to be wielded. Worshippers thus endeavor to inflict as much torture and misery as possible on themselves and others; they look to the cruel outsiders known as velstracs for inspiration, including the use of spiked chains as a primary weapon.",
											"The anguish Zon-Kuthon teaches is not limited to physical injury. Zon-Kuthon teaches his followers to understand, overcome, and revel in psychological pain as well, breaking down morality and twisting compassion into numb pragmatism. This is best exemplified by his troubled relationship with his sister Shelyn, who hopes to redeem him despite all evidence as to the impossibility of this task, and his chaining of his own father, breaking the deity's spirit and transforming him into the hateful servitor now known as the Prince in Chains.",
											"Some worship Zon-Kuthon out of necessity, especially in Nidal, where veneration of the Midnight Lord is heavily interwoven into the culture and political landscape, and where deviation from this dark norm generally leads to tragic results. Outside those borders, some contemptible individuals gravitate toward a faith that allows them to embrace and practice their own sadistic desires. Still others find that Zon-Kuthon provides a level of understanding in the face of inescapable pain: to some, the bleak faith offers a means of finding release when faced with an inability to feel.",
											"Zon-Kuthon is cruel, but he is patient, willing to collaborate with others, and unlikely to provoke conflicts with other gods. He keeps to himself, though one might argue that this is more a case of other deities keeping their distance from him. Likewise, his followers tend to keep their own counsel, perhaps seeming aloof to others, but they have no qualms about working with others to achieve shared goals. The god, his church, and his nation on Gods of the Inner Sea all operate within a strict, unyielding hierarchy that followers understand and uphold, each playing their part as dictated by the Midnight Lord's teachings.",
											"Regardless of the worshipper or their reasons for following the Midnight Lord, his worship is terrible and merciless, often bloody, and sometimes deadly. The faithful are often easily identified by their countless scars\u2014many of them self-inflicted in the course of regular prayers\u2014and frequently piercings and other body modifications, though tattoos are relatively rare among Kuthites. More profound, perhaps, is the cold, detached gaze of a truly faithful worshipper, their unflinching calm in the face of imminent danger, and their rapturous acceptance of any harm that befalls them.",
											"Though priests of Zon-Kuthon hold positions of power and respect within Nidal, they are few and far between beyond its borders. Somewhat more common are the infamous shadowcallers, who practice divinely inspired wizardry and other sorts of magic, and vicious itinerant clerics and champions who scour the land in an inquisition, seeking out naysayers and rebels."

											"While Achaekek's divine genesis is heavily debated among scholars, it is believed that he was created\u2014either by the power of a singular deity or a group of them\u2014to eradicate those who would steal a god's divinity, and he has since become the enforcer of divine punishment. Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard's spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale. He keeps no formal relationships with any other deities, even his sister, {@deity Grandmother Spider|LOGM}, who repeatedly coaxes Achaekek to rebel against the gods and abandon his duties. In response, even though some gods disapprove of Achaekek's methods, few openly defy him.",
											"Many of Achaekek's faithful attribute the Mantis God with a masculine identity, though Achaekek holds himself beyond the mortal conventions of gender just as he eschews ancestry and most mortal affairs. He does not actively seek worshippers, though the Red Mantis assassins' guild devotes itself to tenets curated around his persona and tactics. Red Mantises believe their assassinations are a sacred rite: just as their deity stays his hand against rightful gods, the assassins refuse to strike against rightful rulers\u2014but all others are fair game. Some ferocious druids and rangers worship Achaekek to emulate the god's efficiency in killing their targets. The deity's faith is also known to attract mortals who kill for coin, whether from a hope of someday joining the Red Mantis or at the direction of their own cults or guilds. Regardless of any association with the Red Mantis, priests of Achaekek are expected to act as assassins of some kind when the opportunity arises, whatever their skill or training. This may manifest in an obvious opportunity presaged by an omen from Achaekek, such as a mantis resting on the shoulder of a public speaker, or a more direct message from Red Mantis agents. Achaekek's followers believe assassination for the sake of self defense or vengeance does not require any sort of payment. However, assassins who kill for reasons that do not involve any personal interest or personal advancement deserve appropriate compensation, at least in the eyes of Achaekek's faithful."

											"Alseta holds sway over transitions. Physical transitions through doorways and portals or over thresholds, metaphorical transitions, and even the forward flow of time\u2014Alseta influences them all. She watches over city gates, helping keep invaders out and defenders safe. She also watches over those moving into a new stage in life, whether that means a birthday, a marriage, or a more fitting body. It is common for anyone entering into a life change, such as moving to a new town or changing careers, to look to Alseta for guidance. Likewise, birth and death are both transitions, and expectant mothers and the bereaved both offer her prayers, linking Alseta's church to that of Pharasma. Some consider Alseta to be the goddess of teleportation, though she does not officially claim that title. She is also a popular god among some elven nations and cultures, who frequently associate Alseta with the aiudara, or elf gates, around Gods of the Inner Sea.",
											"As the Welcomer, Alseta also believes in courtesy. She treats every being, from the smallest animal to the most powerful gods, with civility and respect, and she expects that same treatment in return. She also expects her followers to follow suit and use courtesy when interacting with others. Alseta's followers typically include diplomats, negotiators, and other members of local governing bodies. Alsetan priests are noted for their fair and impartial interactions with others, and many of them are called on to aid locals or even other churches with resolving disputes or to oversee important ceremonies.",
											"Alseta most often appears as a kindly older woman wearing a smiling mask on the back of her head. She wears simple clothing, usually colored gray. When she speaks, she does so with carefully considered words. Her voice carries tremendous authority and wisdom, and the weight of it is hard to ignore."

Long after her mortal death, she returned as a herald of the god Aroden and fought alongside mortals during one of their darkest hours. But humanity and her patron alike abandoned her\u2014first to the Whispering Tyrant, then to the necromancer Geb\u2014and the torments she endured because of it changed her deeply. Still she survived, her broken body reanimated against her will as a powerful undead monstrosity. For over a millennium she was held captive as the lich queen of the undead nation of Geb, and her view of mortals, and humanity in particular, soured.",
											"Only recently was Arazni able to reclaim her autonomy, manipulating the Whispering Tyrant into using his own magic to shatter her arcane bonds. The Unyielding defends her reclaimed freedom with unparalleled vigor, scorns those who supplicate her, and exacts swift retribution against those who wrong her. She treats petitioners who honored her in her despised role as queen of Geb, or who pray to her only now that she has reclaimed her power, with pure contempt. Arazni might have learned the art of unflinching cruelty and found ways to embrace and savor what power she had as a means of self defense, but she holds a deep -seated disdain for those who think that what she has become is worthy of veneration.",
											"Arazni feels little kinship with either humanity or undead, save a faint affinity to those who have been denied agency as she was. She also recognizes, grudgingly, that the Knights of Lastwall share her hatred of the Whispering Tyrant; a number of these dispossessed knights, disenchanted and embittered by the failure of their leaders to keep Tar -Baphon imprisoned, even consider Arazni something of a patron. Yet these disparate followers are few and far between, less a church and more a scattering of worshippers who see in the Unyielding something of themselves."

											"Once nothing more than a powerful spirit of water with the ability to manipulate sea monsters, Besmara grew slowly in power over the centuries from sacrifices made by seafaring people. After defeating and consuming rival spirits of battle, gold, and wood, she became a minor god of piracy, strife, and sea monsters.",
											"Besmara, the Pirate Queen, cuts a brash and bold figure, as she often is depicted wearing buccaneer apparel consisting of loose-fitting, eye-catching clothing and black boots, and her hair is wind-tossed on even the calmest day. She and her followers adhere to a simple code of greed: take what you desire, no matter who it might belong to. Despite this, Besmara and her worshippers are generally loyal to one another, knowing that while on the waves raiding ships for treasure, a pirate crew can survive only if its members trust one another.",
											"Besmara is no fool, though. She knows to fall back if obtaining a certain treasure proves too difficult; in fact, she currently bides her time, waiting for an opportunity to gain more deific power, even while she steals from other minor divinities. She is not above fighting dirty if she believes it will give her the upper hand in a battle, and she sometimes encourages her followers to foment conflict between other groups so they can take advantage of the ensuing chaos. Besmara thrives in areas where piracy is difficult to control or even encouraged, such as Ilizmagorti and the Shackles, and her followers chafe at any laws that would curtail their personal freedoms.",
											"Most of Besmara's followers are those who live their lives in and around the seas of Gods of the Inner Sea, typically pirates or others whose livelihood relies on piracy. This includes both the vilest of high-seas murderers and the privateers who seek them out. However, even non-followers utter prayers to the Pirate Queen as they set sail or as storms approach. Besmara rarely cares when those of other faiths are at sea, so long as she receives respect and her fair share of tribute from treasure."

Some believe she was a construct who achieved consciousness and a spark of divinity, while others think she was a human alchemist and inventor who discovered ways to fuse mechanical components with her own physiology. Regardless of her origins, Brigh is a patient and thoughtful god who promotes unending curiosity and constant intellectual advancement. Her two most common forms are a humanoid woman made of bronze clockwork and a human woman wearing a bronze skullcap and armor composed of gears and other movable metal pieces. Though Brigh's usual demeanor is composed and reserved, she isn't an unfeeling automaton; she deeply cherishes the creations she and her followers make, and most of her worshippers feel the same way.",
											"Brigh's faith isn't as widespread as that of most other gods, though she does have pockets of worship in areas where machinery and constructs are common. Among these are Alkenstar, where much of that city's production of firearms is overseen by priests of Brigh; Numeria, where the proliferation of strange technological artifacts draws followers of the Whisper in Bronze like moths to a flame; and Absalom, where the mysterious Clockwork Cathedral teaches the crafts of mechanical engineering and construct-building to eager students. Brigh encourages her faithful to improve upon the work of others and allow others to build on their own achievements in turn. Typical followers of Brigh are those who work with their hands, especially gem cutters, inventors, and toy makers. Numerous gnomes are drawn to her religion, thanks to its emphasis on searching for new and exciting innovations. Many of her followers dedicate their lives to research and projects of great scope, crafting magnificent inventions that take years to create. Other followers are content with creating smaller inventions or tinkering with those of others. Brigh is pleased regardless of the size of the project, so long as new technologies and discoveries result from the work."

Formerly an artificial intelligence cloned from the mind of an android from outer space, Casandalee gained her godhood in the heart of Numeria within the computer core of a crashed spaceship, becoming the patron of artificial life, free thinking, and intellectual apotheosis.",
											"Though she is sometimes referred to as the Iron Goddess, Casandalee is much more than simple metal. She sometimes appears as a holographic reconstruction of her android form: a female humanoid with purple hair, blue lips, and pale skin traced with glowing circuitry, but upon close inspection, this image seems to consist of millions of complex algorithms of pure light. Casandalee and her followers seek to promote the advancement of Gods of the Inner Sea's technology so that the world's inhabitants can better understand\u2014and not fear\u2014the complex mechanisms of so-called artificial life, including androids and free -willed artificial intelligences. Many androids consider themselves the chosen people of Casandalee and depict her as an obvious android with more circuitry or exposed components.",
											"As a young deity, Casandalee has very few followers, the majority of whom live in Numeria. Outside of that country, adherents are usually seen as eccentric outsiders who wield items of advanced technology that seem to work like magic. Traveling priests of Casandalee search for signs of similar equipment that might have been brought from Numeria, in hopes that such discoveries will lead them to beings of artificial life who would benefit from Casandalee's message. In addition, these priests help those who have uncovered or built advanced technology to use it responsibly and understand the science behind it. Many of Casandalee's concerns overlap with those of Brigh, and the two faiths often work together, though the concepts of artificial intelligence can sometimes be hard for followers of Brigh to fully grasp."

											"Chaldira Zuzaristan, the Calamitous Turn, is a plucky, impulsive goddess venerated primarily by halflings. She embodies two aspects halflings see in themselves: a strong affinity for luck and bold determination to protect friends. Chaldira is hotheaded and cannot abide bullies in any form, and many of her worshippers are similarly impetuous, spoiling for any opportunity to leap fist-first at oppressors and tyrants. While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others' expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira's followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. Chaldira is most often depicted as a halfling woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons.",
											"Chaldira's church is very casual, with few formal priests; most congregations are led by lay priests who pursue a full-time job and work hard to preserve halfling customs, strengthen ties between neighbors, and lift the underprivileged in the community out of poverty. True clerics of Chaldira are responsible for running the church as a whole, as well as petitioning secular leadership for further laws that promote equality. Many Chaldirans support the Bellflower Network, a clandestine organization that labors to free halflings from slavery throughout the Inner Sea region, but principally in Cheliax.",
											"Chaldira is a common companion of Desna, but she considers herself a close friend of nearly all non-evil gods and delights in telling exaggerated tales of their escapades, particularly when such tales involve mischief or embarrassing situations. Even reserved deities such as Erastil or Irori often find themselves pulled into adventures by the irrepressibly friendly goddess\u2014whether they like it or not. Chaldira's chief foe among the gods is Thamir, an evil god venerated by desperate and misanthropic halflings."

It is said that the Gossamer King was once swaddled in a cocoon, but was released by the curious Desna into the world with a cleave of her starknife. Since then, the goddess has pursued him in a macabre dance, hoping to kill him as they flit between planes.",

His priests are survivors of virulent childhood illnesses that left them changed and embittered, or those who have suffered gruesome tortures or terrible torments at the hands of inexperienced healers and wish to subject others to the same. He attracts misanthropes who wish to spread sickness, drawing from ostracized lepers, those injured and infected in war, and those riddled with pox. Ghlaunder tasks his followers with spreading sickness wherever they go, whether via an illness that they carry themselves or a plague they introduce by other means. Those who speak of him with reverence do so in hushed tones, and their foes include the likes of doctors, midwives, and followers of the goddess Desna.",

They gather together away from prying eyes and wail to their god, bringing him offerings of rancid meat and fetid bodies, then infesting themselves with leeches and parasites. Ghlaunder's desires are clear: he wants nothing more than to hear cries of anguish in the night when he hovers in the sky, knowing those who suffer below him are rotting from the inside out."

Also known as Nana Anadi, Grandmother Spider was once content in her role as weaver of fate for the gods, as it gave her the ability to craft the grandest tales anyone had ever known. But as she told story after story at the other gods' whims, they failed to show proper respect to the one who made their glorious and terrible legends come to pass, treating her as a servant or a tool. Grandmother had no patience for overinflated egos, and even less for those who take credit for the work of others.

Some of the more prideful gods deny her still\u2014worshiping Grandmother Spider is forbidden by {@deity Asmodeus} for as long as she still twirls copies of his keys around her fingers, and {@deity Abadar} still holds a grudge since the Century of the Unbalanced Scale.

Abolitionists and freedom fighters across Mwangi view spiders as an omen of good fortune. Those who are forced to live and fight in secret against their oppressors take great comfort in the knowledge that Nana Anadi will still tell their stories long after they are gone."

											"Ancient beyond mortal reckoning, Groetus is an entity who cannot be easily understood. He hangs in the sky above the Boneyard, a skull-faced moon constantly observing the passage of the souls below. Events can cause him to draw ominously closer to Pharasma's Spire, or to retreat back to a safer distance, with little obvious rhyme or reason for these actions. He evinces little regard for anything but his singular aim: the dissolution of the universe.",
											"While it may seem strange that a deity who seems to actively disregard his worshippers continues to attract faithful followers, Groetus is sought out with morbid fascination by those who desire knowledge of the future. With perfect insight into the final fate of the cosmos, Groetus is able to piece together many of the horrifying possibilities of what is yet to come. For those granted glimpses of such futures, the terrible knowledge is often enough to permanently warp their view of reality. Such unfortunate individuals are often compelled to spread word of the coming triumph of Groetus, warning all those who will listen that the days of the universe are numbered. Groetus is also venerated by those eager for the end of the world, because they either see little value in the current order, find it too painful to cope with reality, or believe the universe is irredeemably flawed and must be destroyed. Many of these followers are more eager for destruction than Groetus himself, who reacts to events that hasten and delay the end times alike with little more than detached acknowledgment. The end is inevitable, and Groetus is patient.",
											"Groetus has no organized church. Most of his clergy are solitary, wandering doomsayers, though some attach themselves to war bands or teams of bandits and encourage such groups to spread chaos. Those who feel themselves guided by the god work to fulfill the conditions of obscure prophecies they feel will quicken the destruction of reality and allow Groetus to close the book of the universe."

Temples are open to all and maintain extensive libraries to encourage multilingual literacy; books are often freely given and taken from the Keeper's shrines. Aware that it's difficult to prioritize education or seek transcendence when basic needs are unmet, the Keeper's advocates work to remove structural barriers and ensure everyone has access to the basic comforts and tools they need to guide themselves toward enlightenment.",

He may be so moved by a fisher's prayer that he blesses her with a catch large enough to feed her village, while later unleashing torrential waves against that same village for a slight. This unpredictability leads the rest of the Heavenly Court to regard him as troublesome, and mortals to view him with wary respect.",

Hei Fengan priests usually come through in a crisis, but since they tend to be as tempestuous as their deity, their presence can be something of a mixed blessing. Hei Feng is the patron of tengus (and himself takes the form of a tengu with smoking black feathers). His faith is seen mostly in Tian Xia, though his worship has since spread across Gods of the Inner Sea and especially to the Shackles, where sailors and tengu pirates pray for safe voyages between islands."

After the catastrophe of Earthfall, however, her edge softened; those who struggled to put the world back together called upon her to protect their neighbors and came together under her guidance to build strong bonds of community and support.",

Her churches support the downtrodden and reinforce better ways to work alongside one another for compassionate goals. Clerics of Kazutal ask her for strength so they can help those around them and protect them from danger, enriching their communities with civic pride and keeping a sharp eye out for internal dangers and bad actors among their flock. Warpriests of Kazutal rely on the deadly edge of their machetes to fight against corrupting and oppressive forces in the world. Above all, Kazutal's clergy preaches the strength of love, both for other people and the cultures they form, which gives followers the strength to fight without compromise or weakness to protect those they hold dear.",
											"Kazutal is largely unknown in the Inner Sea region. Over the last few years, however, her clerics have ventured to Avistan in response to contact from Chelaxian colonists near the Arcadian city of Segada. Kazutal's teachings of liberty and safety rapidly attracted a number of former slaves after the recent abolitionist success in Absalom, and her emphasis on community brought many of these disparate people together into a political bloc during a crucial time. Other churches of Kazutal are found in Garund, particularly in Senghor and other cities where merchants have traded with Arcadia."

Known as the Strong Man, Kurgess stands as both champion and shining example to those who seek athletic achievement and to give their all in competition, regardless of whether they are victorious or not.",

Worshippers of Kurgess revel in their strength, eager to show off; this is motivated less by pride, however, than by a desire to inspire others to strive for their own potential. While the teachings of Kurgess emphasize physicality, wizards and other students of magic occasionally find inspiration in the Strong Man's example, delving into the study of magic with the same zeal more traditional worshippers apply to physical exercises. Some spellcasters believe that keeping one's body in good shape helps keep one's mind just as sharp, and they actively seek to bolster their physical prowess as part of their path toward developing their mental acuity and endurance. Regardless of their methods, Kurgessans are commonly jovial and encouraging, even to their rivals, and their companions often cannot help but be inspired by their enthusiasm.",
											"While Kurgessans are willing to demonstrate their strength in combat, especially to protect others or defend their ideals, followers of the Strong Man take no pleasure in mortal combat or the deaths of even the direst of enemies. By and large a light-hearted lot, Kurgessans prefer training, games, and friendly competition to war and bloody conflict. When the need arises, however, Kurgessans can be found on the front lines of combat, and heroic orders such as the Knights of Lastwall often count Kurgessan champions among their ranks."

As a subtle tell to other Milanites of the structure's true intent, these buildings usually feature a small rose garden or other rose iconography. One of the most famous and oldest of these safe havens is an inn in Absalom known as the Sanguine Thorn, which served as a staging point for hundreds of successful liberation attempts in the area. While most believe the tavern was destroyed in the earthquake that devastated Absalom's Precipice District, rumors circulate about a traveling wagon caravan that secretly uses the tavern's name to refer to the collective of Milanites who travel with it, moving from place to place undermining persecution in all its forms and fighting for freedom at all costs."

											"Goddess of gems, stealth, and gambling, Nivi Rhombodazzle is the ultimate high roller, said to have won her divinity from the dwarven god Torag in exchange for a gemstone. She was once a mortal gnome who loved the thrill of an exciting wager, up to and including the moment when the dice turned against her. Eventually, Nivi's debts grew too great for her to remain in her surface home, and she fled into the depths of the Darklands to evade the wrath of her creditors. Most of her adventures in the lightless lands are lost to time and history, but she ultimately emerged reborn as a goddess, hailed as the first of the svirfneblin\u2014uncanny underground gnomes with unique magical abilities and immunity to the dread Bleaching, a wasting curse that claims the lives of gnomes who succumb to boredom and ennui.",
											"Nivi's church appeals most strongly to the svirfneblin of the Darklands, but many gnomes who live upon the surface believe the goddess's tenets can protect them from the wasting effects of the Bleaching. Nivi is not exclusively a gnome deity, however, and she welcomes the worship of any risk-taker who is willing to roll the dice and let them fall where they may. Once Nivi's worship is established in an area, it often spreads quite quickly, particularly amongst gnomes. While it's unclear whether or not Nivi actually has any direct ability to protect gnomes who worship her from the Bleaching, her faith's encouragement of gambling and risky behaviors serves as a potent inoculation against boredom and ennui. Even those not subject to the Bleaching often find Nivi's faith to be entertaining, at the very least.",
											"Nivi's temples tend to serve dual roles, acting both as places of worship and shelters in times of dangers. Such temples always have secret tunnels, hidden rooms, or other escape routes to ensure that there is always a safe exit from the temple in case its inhabitants become trapped within. Most of her temples and shrines are built into inconspicuous locales, such as basements of shops and gambling halls\u2014the latter are particularly common gathering sites for her faithful."

											"No ancient record reveals the truth of Sivanah's origins; in fact, only recent documents record her existence at all. The Seventh Veil is widely regarded as the goddess of illusion magic, often portrayed as a figure disguised by seven veils. Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry\u2014human, elf, halfling, gnome, anadi, and naga\u2014but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess's true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from the Shadow Plane, though the goddess's true nature and form continue to be topics of debate. Even her female visage, while agreed upon by her followers, could likewise be an illusion. Her goals are hidden from even her most faithful, which some believe to have hampered the faith's growth and influence beyond the level of a cult.",
											"Sivanah is well loved by gnomes, who believe the goddess embodies a playful dance between illusion and reality. Gnomes who are drawn to magic and illusions are especially likely to pay their respects to Sivanah, and some wear knotted scarves to honor the goddess of illusions. Anadis are also sometimes drawn to Sivanah, though there is some contention among religious scholars over whether Sivanah's fifth veil truly obscures an anadi or some other being known for its mastery of illusion, as older legends claim the fifth veil concealed a cyclops. Outside of gnomes and anadi, Sivanah draws those who benefit from hiding their appearance or intentions, whether they're illusionists or thieves, or simply wish to live and present a different lifestyle than the one they currently have.",
											"The Seventh Veil safeguards those who plead for secrecy, especially those in disguise for their safety. As the goddess of reflections, Sivanah employs mirrors, reflections in water, and even sometimes shadows to connect with her most faithful. She has a rivalry with Zon-Kuthon, loathing the dark god's corruption of shadows, and she sometimes uses her influence to cause darkness to act unexpectedly for the Midnight Lord's clerics."

She is revered as the ruler of the Tian pantheon, respected as the finest samurai in Heaven or Gods of the Inner Sea, and honored as the patron of nature and emperors alike. Perhaps the most famous tale about her is that of Shizuru and her lover Tsukiyo, the moon god. After Tsukiyo was slain by his brother Fumeiyoshi in a fit of jealousy, Shizuru brought the moon god back to life with the aid of Qi Zhong, the god of medicine. Sadly, Tsukiyo was deeply affected by his experience with death, and though he and Shizuru still love each other, the event created a rift between them. Even so, on the days of an eclipse, they embrace as one.",
											"Followers of Shizuru lead structured lives. Their dedication to duty is nigh absolute, both to fulfill their responsibilities to earth and Heaven and to distract from the personal sorrows they often share with their goddess. To better dedicate themselves to their cause, many Shizurans are emotionally reserved, preferring to lead lives distant from others. Even so, many of Shizuru's priests earn the respect of the communities in or near which they reside, with locals calling upon these priests to aid in times of danger. Her most devout worshippers take up swordplay as both a practical tool of battle and a means to hone the mind and body. Many liken this to the practices of Iomedae's clergy, even going so far as treat the two deities as sister goddesses, though Shizuru's faithful prefer diplomacy to battle and pray for peaceful days instead of glorious war. All the same, followers of Shizuru consider themselves allies of Iomedae, as the Empress of Heaven holds a half-concealed fondness for the younger and more idealistic goddess.",
											"Though Shizuru is mainly worshipped in Tian Xia, especially in the nation of Minkai and other Tian-Min nations, Tian immigrants to Brevoy, Mendev, and Varisia have brought their worship with them. These immigrants often treat their faith as a connection to their homelands, paying homage to the Empress of Heaven as a way of honoring their ancestors and heritage."

											"Tsukiyo has found a great following among those whom society shuns or strikes down for their differences, particularly those with mental illnesses or disabilities. Though his church primarily operates in Tian Xia, followers of Tsukiyo tend to be wanderers by nature and can be found anywhere in the world. In particular, Tian immigrants established a strong following in Ustalav and Varisia. Members of Tsukiyo's clergy tend to take up the role of wandering counselors, offering wisdom, guidance, and therapy to those in need wherever they go, and they are welcomed in almost any community for their services. When engaging with those with mental illness or disability, priests of Tsukiyo prefer to offer assistance by teaching communities to respect and celebrate these individuals. Tsukiyan priests never attempt to treat these individuals unless they desire such assistance."

He is the original creator of the babau demons, and those whom he personally flays and corrupts with Abyssal influence remain exemplars of their kind. Shax appears as a human man with a dove's head, feet, and wings, carrying countless knives and other weapons all over his body. Shax is most frequently worshipped by sadists, lone murderers, and serial killers."

Though Treerazer is a nascent demon lord, and thus lacks the power of a true demon lord, he is perhaps most noteworthy among those who have a stake in Golarion due to his physical presence within the Tanglebriar, a corrupted, fetid swamp that was once the southern edges of the elven nation of Kyonin. He is served by devoted cultists in and around Kyonin, though small pockets of believers can be found around Golarion working furtively to free him in hopes of gaining his favor upon his ascension.

Planar scholars who know of the benevolent lord of earth speak of Sairazul as a mother and creator who gave birth to numerous races of outsiders, including agrawghs and xiomorns. She is currently imprisoned within the {@i Moaning Diamond}, a pure gemstone encircled by eternally crying winds, unable to contact the outside world. Several of her consorts still live to this day, searching the planes for her prison in the hopes that her release will usher in an era of renewed creation across the Plane of Earth. Though the Crystalline Queen can't grant power of any kind to her followers, a handful of her children on the Plane of Earth remain faithful to their creator, and she is remembered with great reverence by Material Plane cultists who exalt creation and reproduction."

For these reasons, her likeness is often found in courts, where she can watch over and ensure fairness to those accused of crimes. Andoletta also places great value on respect for the dead and the protection of children. To offer solace to the bereaved is true kindness and compassion. Children are slates with tremendous potential for good\u2014if they can be guided and kept safe from evil.",

She sometimes instead appears as a human woman with the head of an osprey. In this form she wears robes that sway like the waves of the sea, their blue folds foaming white at the edges, and she carries a teak longbow strung with gold. When she speaks, her voice carries the sound of the crashing waves. Followers of Ylimancha include fishers, sailors, merfolk, those who make their living on or in the sea, and flying creatures."

She believes that mysteries lead to truth, but how one arrives at that truth is as important as the answer itself. All questions are puzzles, and all puzzles are worth solving.

Calculated, logical thinking is more important to Zohls than gut instinct. She sees patterns everywhere, and she teaches that detecting these patterns brings the truth to light. While all investigations are worth pursuing so long as they don't hurt innocents, investigations that reveal the truth of crimes or other horrors, and that lead to justice being served and victims finding peace, are the most important of all to Verity.",

Seeking out Charon is quite the act of desperation, yet there are benefits. The Boatman navigates the Styx, whose waters hold the multiverse's forgotten secrets, any of which he might retrieve in exchange for servitude. His daemons often create undead minions and those who survive their fiendish creators are as likely to turn to Charon as they are to flee Abaddon altogether.

He works toward this feat through his avatar, the King in Yellow, which can manifest anywhere in the universe the light from Carcosa's sun can be seen. The King in Yellow appears as a humanoid figure draped in yellow clothing, but there is nothing within the clothes save a shapeless, horrifying presence. Hastur himself is also referred to as Him Who Is Not To Be Named, or simply the Unspeakable.",

Cults of Hastur are united in their use of the Yellow Sign, a triskelion design that allows Hastur to observe and possess those who gaze upon it. The presence of the Yellow Sign among a city's graffiti is a foreboding indication that Hastur's attention has been drawn there, and these settlements soon find themselves under attack either by Hastur himself\u2014who seeks to draw cities into Carcosa, fueling his transformation into an Outer God\u2014or by Xhamen-Dor, a parasitic deity spawned by Hastur as he walked Carcosa's sewers."

Yog-Sothoth reveals the true nature of the universe, but this is a thing that once seen cannot be unseen, and wise mortals turn aside from Yog-Sothoth's offer of cosmic knowledge in favor of a more mundane existence."

											"Based in Ustalav but active in aristocratic salons and cloistered academies across Avistan and Garund, the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye is a mystic order of occultist-nobles who seek philosophical self-awareness and mastery of celestial truths. The order was founded in 3988 ar when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts\u2014both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter\u2014has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 ar. The Esoteric Order's meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened. The order's greatest accomplishment, however, was averting a doomsday few on Golarion will ever realize was imminent: in 4718 ar, the order's greatest heroes prevented the planet Aucturn from devouring Golarion.",
											"As a secretive organization of the wealthy and powerful, the order is the subject of innumerable conspiracy theories. Rumors hint at devil worship, psychological manipulation, and outright fraud. The order rarely deigns to address these insinuations, which leaves them free to fester.",
											"Members of the order wear eccentric faux-Osirian garb in their private meeting houses, which they call cathedrals. This clothing consists of gloves, robes, aprons, ornamental weapons, and more, each with layers of ceremonial meaning that even the wearer may not yet be permitted to understand. Cathedral services are often elaborate ceremonies, such as séances, mummy unwrappings, and similar affairs. Cathedrals are designed to aid research and social networking, and to that end they often include exclusive libraries and private social clubs. Outside of cathedral, members wear inconspicuous symbols of the order; the most common of these is a golden scarab bearing the Palatine Eye\u2014an open, blazing eye\u2014upon its shell.",
											"The order's most earnest members wholeheartedly believe the secrets hinted at within Aldus's fragmentary lost gospels of Tabris: that each person contains a mote of celestial energy seeking reunification with the primordial heavenly realms. Cultivating this divine spark requires diligent research, convoluted ritual, and gradual ascension through the order's ranks."

											"The ancient art of god calling was once the predominant religious practice in Sarkoris, long before the Worldwound erupted and demons drove most of the native Sarkorians from their homelands. This art, one part magical theory and one part religion, allows certain Sarkorians to summon unusual and unique beings from the Great Beyond who protect their clans and guide their people. These creatures are typically referred to as gods by those who revere them, and they continue to return and guide their people generation after generation, so long as someone trained by a previous god caller or otherwise educated in the practice of communing with a particular god is alive to form a tether to the Material Plane so that the god can manifest. These god callers may have unique titles or names among the people of their clan, and such monikers differ from clan to clan, but most of the clans of Sarkoris are able to distinguish a god caller by their unique dress or glyph that ties the caller to their god.",
											"The creatures summoned by god callers often appear as animals, such as wolves or bears, with one or more prominent features that make their otherworldliness plain to see. One might manifest as a bear with a feathery mane, a wolf sprouting eagle's wings, or some other combination of features. Many Sarkorians tell stories of the first gods of Sarkoris, like the Stag Mother of the Forest, and believe that these first gods were the perfect embodiment of creatures of the natural world. As the clans intermarried, new gods were born to god callers of these lines, leading to the hybrid forms common among the few remaining Sarkorian clans. Some of these new gods even resemble extraplanar creatures like angels or psychopomps, though they always have some signifier to distinguish them as something different than these beings.",
											"Regardless of how they came to worship the gods of Sarkoris, those who claim the title of god caller\u2014much like those who call themselves children of Sarkoris\u2014are now as diverse in appearance and custom as all the nations of the Inner Sea region. This diversity not only strengthens the clans and people of Sarkoris but also the power of the new clan gods who draw their form and function from their people. All god callers and their followers share a deep-rooted respect for the gods who walk among them, imparting their wisdom and sharing their strength directly with their people."

Druidic rites are sometimes performed within a circle of standing stones or wooden pillars, which serve as both celestial markers and pillars of knowledge. Ancient members of the Green Faith have been known to preserve their convoluted wisdom for future generations by reverently carving runes into the stones, leaving behind whispers of knowledge for those who seek to understand nature's mysteries."

While each order's practitioners may be drawn to a particular element, season, creature, or natural occurrence, all followers respect the sanctity and importance of every aspect of nature.",
											"Many cycles have passed since the Green Faith's fabled founders contended over which expression of natural power was supreme. Just as the legend speaks of their ultimate unity, those who now follow the Green Faith and view nature as sacred understand the interconnectedness of all beings, recognizing that harmony is possible only through balance, and that the cycles of nature are both delicate and infinite. Advocates of the Green Faith therefore fall into a neutral alignment, for they understand that by naming one thing, its opposite is also created; they walk the path of balance between death and rebirth, light and shadow, growth and decay.",
											"Druids and rangers are frequently followers of the Green Faith, as their lives and magic are especially linked to nature whether they tend a simple garden or roam the vast wilderness. Champions are rare among the Green Faith and are usually champions of nature deities, but they are no less devoted than champions of other faiths. Some clans worship as a community, calling on the power or attributes of specific animals and elements, while others build their lives around nature's endless cycles. Priests of the Green Faith often travel to educate settlements on living sustainably, caring for animals and crops, anticipating the weather, and finding useful herbs and fungi. Most members of the Green Faith do not oppose civilization, so long as it is built with respect for the natural world that surrounds it. In addition to holding nature sacrosanct, they believe that access to nature's beauty is essential to the health of all people, whether isolated nomads or metropolitan urbanites.",
											"Though the Green Faith has no official church, the faith nonetheless maintains a structure of sorts. Most notably, the majority of the faith's adherents belong to one of several orders dedicated to a particular aspect of nature, such as air, beasts, or plants. The more prominent orders, such as the Order of the Leaf and Order of the Storm, span all of Golarion, while more niche orders, like the Order of the Rift, commit themselves to specific areas like volcanoes. Each order maintains oral records and passes its wisdom down through generations. These collections of knowledge can take a lifetime of study to understand, and are thus divided into \"circles.\" Members of an order move through these circles as they gain more knowledge and responsibility within their respective order.",
											"In the Inner Sea region, the Green Faith has the strongest presence in Andoran, the Mwangi Expanse, Nirmathas, Taldor, and the River Kingdoms, though a few dedicated holdouts remain in Sarkoris after the demonic incursion, and members can be found scattered through other realms as well."

Living masks are popular ways to share lore, as are intricate wooden storytelling boards whose patterns are too abstract for the uninitiated to grasp. Most dramatic is the art of tending jungle trees to grow in the shapes of titanic runes. These glyphs only impart their truths to seekers who view them from certain distant perspectives.",

The former trains members to both cure and inflict natural poisons of all kinds, while the latter actively impedes connections between the region's mighty settlements.

											"The Laws of Mortality originated in the Garundi nation of Rahadoum as a response to the Oath Wars, a series of internecine conflicts that were tearing the nation's society apart. The fundamental principle behind the Laws is a relatively simple assertion that deific aid\u2014even the best intentioned\u2014ultimately comes at too high a price. The slaughter of fellow mortals for the glory of distant, unfathomable beings is not something that should be permitted within a society. Instead, mortal beings must shape their own fate, aware of their own limitations, trusting in their reliance upon one another and their shared values rather than divine intervention and guidance. This philosophy is summed up in the primary tenet of the Laws of Mortality: Let no mortal be beholden to a god.",
											"The Laws of Mortality are the cornerstone of Rahadoum's government, and thus religion and worship are banned across the entire nation, enforced by the merciless Pure Legion. As a side effect of this prohibition, Rahadoum's government has a vested interest in supporting its citizens through education and other means, since there is no church to rely upon to provide crucial social services. Within Rahadoum, most civilians are raised to observe the Laws of Mortality, but the code has some adherents beyond the land in which it arose. Most of these followers have seen for themselves the terrible costs of interreligious conflict or have learned of the callous treatment of mortal souls in the Outer Sphere, and as a result they have chosen a position of intentional neutrality. Some of these followers work to spread the philosophy outside of Rahadoum, pointing out the gods' abuses of mortals and the ultimate prices that must be paid for their assistance. Such proselytizers face a difficult, if not impossible, task\u2014but one they face with the same determination with which they face their own mortality.",
											"One of the most obvious results of the Laws of Mortality is that it prohibits the use of many forms of healing magic, as the most common restorative magic is granted by divine favor. Thus alchemists, bards, and other occult spellcasters provide the majority of the Rahadoum's healing, alongside entirely non-magical techniques. Many adherents of the Laws not only refuse to practice divine magic but also refuse to allow such magic to be cast upon them, preferring a death unsullied by divine intervention over one indebted to distant, uncaring deities who trade in souls. Druids' standing with regard to the Laws is sharply divided. Those who don't worship a deity are welcome due to their healing powers and their ability to combat the nation's desertification, but they are viewed with suspicion in some places since their magic shares its instinctual faith-based vital essence with divine magic. Those druids who uphold a deity, however, meet even more antipathy than more traditional theists, as though their reverence of a deity were a hypocritical affront to the natural world they claim to uphold. Likewise, sorcerers whose bloodlines can be traced back to divine sources are viewed with suspicion and distaste."

											"The secular prophecies of Kalistrade are famously centered on a single principle: amassing personal wealth both in search of and as evidence of personal enlightenment. The prophets of Kalistrade, often referred to as Kalistocrats, believe that achieving purity of body, mind, and spirit will lead to financial success, and thus they avoid certain foods and eschew contact with most persons and objects as impure. To avoid contamination and contact with nonbelievers they wear long, white gloves, and they wear distinctive, all-white clothing to represent their purity\u2014often incorporating their symbol, a circle inside a triangle that is itself inscribed in a larger circle.",
											"The human prophet Kalistrade lived in Druma in the third century ar. Following an 8-year journey of enlightenment, he began preaching an economic mysticism that drew on his own dream visions, Druman traditions of industriousness, and Kellid folklore about an earlier religion\u2014the whiteclad Speakers of the Pale. Following his disappearance in 252 ar, his disciples reworked his Ontologies of Self, adding more of his writings and their own commentaries. The resulting momentous tome is the Prophecies of Kalistrade. This sizable text consists of hundreds of pages that compile Kalistrade's core principles and teachings. Among its fables, parables, occult mysticism, and other ramblings are sound economic lessons and many particulars about personal purity. The size of the tome makes it difficult to keep as a reference manual. Instead, most copies of the Prophecies are designed for home use, with many of them printed as large tomes bound in precious metals and embedded with jewels.",
											"Purity of mind, body, and spirit is Kalistrade's fundamental requirement for the attainment of personal affluence. A Kalistocrat achieves purity of mind primarily through meditation, a practice to be called on throughout the day whenever focus deviates from the pursuit of wealth. Mental purity also demands a Kalistocrat avoid any temptations to bestow charity or to be wasteful. Bodily purity, based in principles of ascetic self-denial, is much more complicated. First, the Kalistocrat recognizes three categories of food: pure, clean, and unclean, depending on each ingredient's origin, processing, and nutritional profile. To achieve purity, a practitioner must avoid eating any unclean foods, instead taking simple and light meals (with very occasional exceptions for ostentatious feasting). Second, the Kalistocrat strives to remain free of any physical contact, particularly with nonbelievers. Voluntary touching is assiduously avoided, and involuntary touching is minimized through the use of gloves and enveloping clothing. While the Prophecies enjoin celibacy, many Kalistocrats make some personal exceptions. Most permissible are sexual relations with a likely convert or a wealthy patron\u2014or, better, someone who is both."

											"Sangpotshi is compatible with the faiths of many deities, and it is common for devotees to also hold faith in divine entities. The philosophy often influences their methods of worship, with Abadarans keeping careful records of their wealth or even investing money for a future incarnation, and Pharasmins beseeching the psychopomp bureaucracy to look favorably upon their deeds in life and shepherd their future selves to enlightenment. Some worshippers of malicious deities follow a twisted version of Sangpotshi, seeking to extend their existences through undeath and using the time gained to perfect their stations in this incarnation. Most adherents of the traditional teachings, by contrast, consider undead to be prisons for souls that lock them away from the cycle of fate and reincarnation, and destroy undead wherever they can be found."

											"The philosophy of Sangpotshi, also known as the River of Life, centers around concepts of fate, karma, and cyclic reincarnation. Adherents believe each soul is judged upon its actions in life, and these actions determine its station when it returns to the living world. This cycle repeats until the soul reaches its perfected form through the accrual of experience and wisdom, whereupon it passes on to Pharasma's court and the afterlife to come.",
											"While the philosophy itself is separate from the faiths of the gods and the facets of multiversal morality, its teachings are most compatible with the ethics of law and good. In the hope of reaching enlightenment, devotees seek to live blameless, selfless lives respectful of tradition, legitimate authority, and the wisdom of those born into certain positions. Many strive to discover and influence the forces that will affect their next life, whether via genealogy, introspection, or the preparation of records for their next life. Genealogists are called upon to provide insight into past lives' failings, so adherents can correct those faults and progress toward enlightenment. Intellectual leaders, meanwhile, are often called upon to aid in matters of the current life, helping adherents live well within the station of their birth, follow the laws and traditions of their societies, and best use the resources available to them.",
											"Followers of Sangpotshi's teachings place great influence on meditation and introspection, as they hope to better understand their own existence and reconcile their being with their past and present actions so they can strive toward the future state they hope to achieve. Such reflection allows followers to understand their own flaws and past mistakes. Acceptance of the past is a pivotal part of the philosophy, as a mortal being can very easily stagnate and lock themselves into an endless cycle of new attempts at improvement that never truly solve the challenges that came before.",
											"Sangpotshi encourages individuals who are unable to fully understand their own mistakes to find others who share similar flaws or difficulties, under the premise that helping others overcome a challenge can also help the individual giving aid and teach them how to overcome their own struggles. Followers are quick to note that attempting to solve the entirety of a neighbor's issues is unhelpful, though, as everyone's path along the River of Life is different. The river teaches tolerance and patience with one another, and that what may seem like an obvious solution or lesson for one should be left for another individual to discover on their own, unless they ask for help.",
											"Sangpotshi places great importance on one's fate, but the philosophy is by no means a passive way of life. Most devotees strive to better themselves, certain that their efforts will be rewarded in a future incarnation, while others actively seek to break from their present circumstances without forsaking the teachings of the philosophy. The latter path is difficult, and not all who attempt it succeed, but those who do find themselves one step closer to ultimate recompense."

Shoanti see the earth not merely as a metaphorical parent, but as a conscious entity whose constant support is necessary for the survival of all life upon it\u2014animal and vegetable alike. Their traditions emphasize connection and the reciprocal way in which the land provides for those who take care of it. The life force of the land serves as the source of Shoanti power and insight, rather than the otherworldly spiritual essence of the Great Beyond common to clerics. This life force is the birth of instinct and faith, and thus it sends omens to indicate future events, warning those with the wisdom to read the signs. Thus most Shoanti hold a profound reverence for natural phenomena as a manifestation of the will of the earth.",
											"Shoanti animism has no required creeds or written doctrine, nor regular worship services. Holy places simply exist, as acknowledged by an individual, family, or quah (a clan). Shamans may designate places of importance, but these are not exclusive. Indeed, little is exclusive or limiting about traditional Shoanti beliefs. Faith is felt by each practitioner; it manifests as an overall attitude toward the land and all that depends on it for life, but it has no hard rules or set restrictions.",
											"Many Shoanti find themselves drawn to particular features of the world around them, forming a bond with a specific river, a particular tree, or a type of creature, but even such connections are fleeting. Most Shoanti agree that such calls from the earth last only as long as a person requires them to survive the rigors of the world or to gain the understanding required to overcome a particular obstacle. Such connections are considered less significant than an individual's connection to a totem, but no less powerful.",
											"Shoanti shamans are usually druids who draw their power from a particularly strong connection to their totem and the earth. Because adherents are welcome to add beliefs, rituals, sites, and objects of worship, shamans are sometimes also clerics of a particular deity, such as Desna or Gozreh."

However, a good number of people choose not to worship any deities whatsoever. Many do so because of the value they place on freedom\u2014not being beholden to a deity means no limitations, no censure, no anathema, and no strictures. While this decision might sound amoral to some, for atheists, it can be motivated by a desire for autonomy and the right to choose one's own fate.",
											"Some atheists feel no particular interest toward any of the gods or the divine in general. As a result, they find the thought of worship pointless and unappealing, a waste of time for both the god and the atheist. While these atheists are most likely to be tolerant of the gods and religion in general, they often chafe at efforts to convert them, seeing such overtures as societal pressure to pretend there is faith where truthfully there is none.",
											"Some atheists are driven by thoughts and fears of the afterlife, and by dismay or outrage at the idea of spending eternity serving at the behest of an eternal master. To such people, a quiet eternity in the Boneyard's graves is akin to a reprieve or a comforting certainty, especially compared to the helpless terror of being judged by a higher power and sent onward to an unknown destination, with little to no say in the matter.",

While these skeptics acknowledge that the gods are undeniably powerful beings, they see little difference between these deities and other powerful entities on Golarion and question what the gods have done to merit the worship of mortals. To them, worship of a deity is akin to revering the power of the Eye of Abendego, or like a kobold's veneration of a nearby dragon. Praise and offerings are demanded for protection, yet the gods are sparing and unreliable with their responses. At best, such worship is demeaning, and at worst it rivals the practice of slavery or, in a slightly more charitable view, indentured servitude.",
											"Finally, some refuse to follow the gods out of anger. Those who believe they have been betrayed by faith in a particular god or wronged by a deity's followers might refuse to revere any deity who would willfully choose to inflict such pain.",
											"The paths these free agents follow vary as much as their reasons for rejecting the divine. Bards turn to the aggregate eclectic knowledge of the beyond. Alchemists and wizards alike seek to understand the universal underpinnings of reality through magic, science, and reason. Any number of barbarians, fighters, rogues, and even sorcerers operate with no need for spiritual guidance or reinforcement. Many monks look inward for guidance, rather than outward, and druids and rangers may uphold the natural order but not the divine.",
											"Some free agents refuse any association with the religious altogether. Others adopt a live-and-let-live policy and are happy to let others worship and work divine feats. Without any assurances of (or desire for) divine intervention, the vast majority of the irreligious instead place their faith in other mortals and endeavor to make the material world a better place for all."

She honors the hours spent daydreaming on the hearth, whether that hearth is next to the fire pit at a remote campsite or in the kitchen of a generations-old homestead. She does not proscribe much. She adds to the serendipitous outlook of the catfolk, enhancing their inborn curiosity. Her worship tends to temper willfulness and wanderlust, reminding her followers of the safety and security to be found in having a spot of their own, even if that spot is temporary. She understands that sometimes the best protection is a retreat and gently reminds her followers of the virtue of impermanence and of existing in the moment. Rather than looking into the past or the future, she enjoins fully inhabiting the present\u2014the place where one is, the hearth by which one naps, the company that one currently keeps, especially when it can be done in solitude.",
									"Because the catfolk of Southern Garund have not established large communities outside of Murraseth, there are no temples to Adanye outside of their homeland, only small shrines erected by travelers, perhaps near seldom-used mountain trails or in the corners of large temples dedicated to other gods. Her worshippers often paint or sketch her holy symbol, a simple paw print in orange (or on an orange background), which is sometimes enhanced with sketched flames or another symbol of fire, in an inconspicuous cornerstone of a building or on a fallen log. Adanye has an affinity with Desna and with Shelyn, given their overlapping interests in dreamers and individualism. Although she has a longstanding rivalry with the Osirian feline goddess Bastet, she does not spend much time feuding. Adanye's care is wholly enjoined upon her followers."

The immortal tyrant punishes anyone who lacks faith with death, and there is no worse blasphemy than to worship a rival god in his city. But the freedom fighter Sihar and her followers, the Bright Lions, have spread the word of the old sun gods in secret, and now they are returning to the people.",
									"Even though it has only been just over a century since Walkena retook the throne, worship of the Old Sun Gods waned before then. Their teachings had been ingrained into day to day life, and many Mzali traditions can be traced directly to rituals started by sun kings\u2014rulers believed to be descended from the old sun gods. But when the Council of Mwanyisa overthrew the sun kings and led Mzali's empire into decline, the people grew complacent in their worship, and in turn, so did the sun gods grow complacent themselves.",
									"After the child-god's rise, Walkena's priests scoured the city of any other deities, smashing statues and temples, editing the truth to Walkena's liking and destroying the rest. In doing so, the names Tlehar, Chohar and Luhar were mostly erased from public memory, with the remnants subverted to Walkena's needs. It was only in the deepest hidden chambers that any sign of their original teachings still existed. Now that they have been rediscovered, Chohar has no intention of being forgotten again.",
									"While Walkena and Chohar both call themselves gods of justice, the Old Sun God abhors Walkena's cruel and merciless sense of the concept. Chohar teaches that it is one's duty to fight for the innocent and powerless, and to never wield power for one's own benefit. The sun god has much grander goals than dealing with what he sees as a mere pretender god, however. Merely defeating the tyrant that rules them would not be enough to undo the generations of misfortune. The people must find a renewed sense of strength and pride, so that they can fight for themselves. Until then, Chohar will shine down on them, offering any protection he can. When the time comes, he will lead his people into a bright future.",
									"While the Old Sun Gods are considered equal in importance, Chohar attracts the largest following of worshippers, both historically and today. Still, even those who prefer the teachings of a particular sun god typically pay respect and homage to the other two as well."

To those that society can't punish, Kalekot is executioner, striking from the shadows and leaving bodies to rot on the ground. To those lost at night, Kalekot is a silent follower, a guardian from danger. Those few who have glimpsed him describe a figure with withered skin and a snake's twisting spine. He always conceals his features behind an eyeless mask, its mouth filled with serpent's teeth, each fang the size of an elephant's tusk.",
									"Only those who have seen the darkest aspects of the world understand Kalekot well enough to seek him out safely. For Kalekot does not spread fear for the joy of it\u2014he spreads it to keep people alive. The world holds many places that should not be visited, many secrets that should never be spread, and many monsters that hide behind smiling faces. Fear keeps people wary and on guard. Fear keeps the childish and curious from seeking out trouble. And fear is the only deterrent that predatory creatures understand. Kalekot and his servants terrify the innocent, but they also stalk the guilty, reminding those who torment others that there will always be a reckoning.",
									"Kalekot is a cynic, who believes he must dirty his hands to keep the souls of others clean. Despite this, he despises those who maintain optimism through ignorance. He favors those who make others uncomfortable through no wrong of their own\u2014those with disfigurements and deformities, the poor, the abused and victimized, taboo breakers, and the monstrous. He is known to watch over those of dual heritage, two-headed creatures, and twins. Some scholars believe Kalekot himself was once a twin, before he buried his double to seal them away for eternity.",
									"Kalekot has a deep love of wild plants; he brews liquid chocolate, coffee, and ciders from jungle fruit, and his priests often use such drinks in their rituals and spells."

Roaming throughout the sky above Golarion, she delights in throwing her bolts into the fields and the minds of people, whenever conditions permit and wherever they may fall. Some believe the smoke from Lubaiko's fires are curses and misfortune flying up into the air to spread throughout the land. Yet Lubaiko's blazes also often clear the way for new growth.",

She loves men's clothing, the passion and tumult that flows with too much brandy, riotous jokes, and stories that make emotions run high. Her humor runs slightly on the sadistic side\u2014she might set someone's sleeve aflame for the fun of it, or laugh hysterically at the bad luck of others, so long as no one (at least, who doesn't deserve it) gets too hurt. Though she had no involvement in the creation of gunpowder, she has likewise adopted it, delighting in burnt powder offerings, cannon salutes, and exploding kegs.",
									"Revolutionaries, inventors, artists, and arsonists alike offer Lubaiko prayers to help their achievements quickly spread. She has also been known to intervene and protect others from destructive strife, such as saving a particular orchid or homestead, though she's as likely to do so on a whim as out of acknowledgment for a desperate plea. She attracts some followers who seek to spark upheaval to change the world, but most of her worshippers share her fascination with unabated power, even if it causes everything to burn to the ground."

Now he not only rejects her gift, but instills so much fear in his followers that their rest is fitful and brief.",
									"The goddess of dusk is most often portrayed as a lioness with the head of a woman, with skin as dark as night and eyes that shine like stars. She is typically depicted at Chohar's right hand, often asleep while the midday lion stands vigil. Some of her worshippers follow her example, taking long naps during the day so that they can be better prepared to keep watch over sleeping companions at night. Luhar's followers believe there is no greater calling than to face the dangers of the night for the sake of those one wants to protect.",
									"There are many gods of dreams, but to Luhar, it is sleep itself that is most precious. Death is simply the final, and most precious, sleep. While still a somber experience, it is not one that followers seek to delay. When death comes, they only pray that it will be painless and swift. Luhar answers these prayers and crafts each death personally, doing everything in her power to make one's final moments peaceful. As such, she has a great disdain for grave robbers, necromancers, and any who would defile her gifts. In the past, priestesses of Luhar would bury the dead with obsidian lion tokens. While the tokens may have been simple trinkets, some believed that if their faith was strong, the black lion would manifest with them in the afterlife and protect their soul until their next life.",
									"In truth, it is not Walkena who Luhar finds most upsetting. It is the people who removed Walkena from his final rest and put his body on display for their own benefit who could not be more abhorrent to the goddess. To turn death into a spectacle for profit went against all of her teachings. When their time came, Luhar did not answer their prayers. Their ends were not peaceful. They were not brief. They did not find rest in her domain.",
									"As for Walkena, she plans to craft a new death for him even more beautiful than the last."

									"Mazludeh was once one among many empyreal lords, responsible for the domains of community stewardship and loving sacrifice. However, her actions during Earthfall and the Age of Darkness saved untold lives in Mwangi. Dismayed by the chaos and loss of life, Mazludeh spurred her fellow empyreal lords into action, forming a divine concordance that protected the Garundi nation of Holomog from devastation. Mazludeh's efforts elevated her to true divinity and the status of the matron goddess of the nation of Holomog. Now the goddess of negotiations and treaties, her followers often travel with merchants and ambassadors. She is also considered the diplomat to the other empyreal lords, able to pass on prayers to those most suited to answer them and persuade celestial beings to see to their fulfillment. Throughout the Mwangi, worshippers of Mazludeh have developed a reputation for being brave, empathetic, and fair even to their enemies.",
									"Over the years, it has become increasingly common for Mwangi communities to pay homage to Mazludeh, especially when constructing new homes and settlements, although more structured worship is still rare. Mazludeh sees the love and care in all Mwangi communities and offers them all the protections she can. Even before her presence there, many edicts of her faith were already common practice, expected of any contributing member of society. New worshippers of Mazludeh were thus required to make very little change to the way they already lived their lives.",
									"Mazludeh is often depicted either as a giant serpent with a mane of eggs and fresh figs, or as a woman with serpents for hair. It is heavily debated among scholars what this dual nature could mean, but most agree that her divinity likely predates humans, and that they adopted her later on. Unlike her worship in other parts of the world, worshippers in Mwangi tend to embrace Mazludeh's duality. To deny either side of her would be to deny a part of her, and both are necessary to fully understand the deity. To them, she represents not only unity with one's neighbors, but unity and coexistence with nature. Living in balance with the food one grows, the animals one hunts, and the land one lives on is just as important anything that happens within the walls of a home."

Thanks to them, citizens of Mzali and beyond have been reminded of her loving embrace, and once again awaken with resolve in their hearts.",
									"Tlehar keeps watch over every birth and new beginning, as there is no greater symbol of hope than new life. Midwives and nurses pray to Tlehar to keep watch over their work and ensure the health of newborns. Those coming to terms with a new gender or sexuality may call on Tlehar's blessing and protection as they learn to better understand themselves. People fleeing from unsafe homes can seek out her followers for safe refuge; these followers of Tlehar wear discrete, iron charms to let others know that they will be ready to fight for them. No matter their needs, Tlehar represents a sanctuary of peace in a sea of fear. It is her hope that the people of Mzali will soon live in fear no longer.",

She is often portrayed on Chohar's left side, opposite her sister, with one hand extended in welcome and the other holding an iron morningstar. While Tlehar is not typically as strict in her justice as her counterparts, she shows no mercy to those who hurt the ones they claim to love. She may be willing to forgive those who offer sincere repentance, but the lioness of the dawn has a will of iron. She believes that sometimes, protecting the hope of a better tomorrow means destroying those who cast darkness over the future."

The worship of Uvuko is widespread in the Mwangi Expanse, found among many lizardfolk tribes, Mbe'ke and Taralu dwarves, and in the more cosmopolitan cities.",
									"Uvuko's followers agree on the ideal of change as an aspect of life, both for themselves and others. Much as Uvuko's constant motion brings renewal to the earth and sky, personal growth and choice allows the world to flourish. When creatures are denied their ability to choose, their energy is lost, and the great cycle of the world threatens to halt. For this reason, adherents of Uvuko adamantly oppose slavery and servitude, and readily fight to end either. Sickness likewise causes a creature to stagnate and rot, and so worshippers often train as healers, helping others to shed their illness like a snake sheds its skin.",
									"Uvuko's worshippers also agree on the paramount importance of looking to the future with an unflinching attitude of eagerness and expectation. The past is the earth to be tilled, the future the endless potential of the empty sky. Evolving into a better self, being prepared for whatever is around the corner, and being self-aware are at the heart of Uvuko's teachings. The need to move on, as the individual changes and grows, whether from a place, a relationship, or a livelihood, is honored among Uvuko's followers.",
									"Despite his age and power, Uvuko is an innocent god\u2014 sometimes, even shy. Rituals to Uvuko are often simply attempts to coax the god into actually visiting. Arguments, misery, or even a cross word spoken in anger can cause the god to dart away, and so priests seeking Uvuko's blessing must be careful to present a welcoming environment."

His worshippers\u2014 almost exclusively serpentfolk who, like their sundered god, dream of one day being restored to power\u2014receive conflicting and incoherent visions from their patron. These visions often center on reuniting Ydersius's head and body to reawaken him to his former potency.",
