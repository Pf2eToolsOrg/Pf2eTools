								"In the city-state of Mzali in the Mwangi Expanse resides an undead being of immense power, a child-sized god-king. In the past, Walkena was a mortal descendant of the gods that ruled over Mzali in ancient times, one of the sun kings from an old empire and a golden age of the city. Ages later, his preserved body was found by members of the Council of Mwanyisa, who ruled Mzali at that time. Believing him to be an omen of the city's impending resurgence, the council took him to put him on display in Mzali. When an army from the Sargavan city of Kalabuto attacked the city, Walkena awoke\u2014this time as an undead creature\u2014and slew each of the invaders in a purging rain of fire."

						"The Cosmic Caravan is known to astronomers and astrologers alike as a collection of constellations in the sky, said to travel forever in a circle around the star Cynosure. The association of a diverse array of gods and demigods thematically linked with the stars and the spaces between is a relatively new faith that first rose to prominence in western Avistan, particularly in Varisia, Nidal, and Ravounel. The deities worshiped by the faithful of the Cosmic Caravan include: Desna, Groetus, and Sarenrae; the empyreal lords Ashava, Black Butterfly, and Pulura; the elven god Ketephys; and the outer god Yog-Sothoth. This faith has been gaining ground particularly in Nidal, where the worship of the night is overwhelmingly associated with Zon-Kuthon, and a rising number of Cosmic Caravan worshipers seek to oppose or, one day, even overthrow the Midnight Lord's theocracy to reclaim the night from the implications that all who dwell in the dark are evil."

						"Natural barriers and vast distances have shaped the Expanse's religions as much as its people, creating a thousand variants comprised of familiar deities and regional faiths. For all the diversity in worship and artistic depiction, common themes unite the Mwangi approach to worship.",
						"At the root of their identities, the gods are symbolic expressions of the Mwangi Expanse's most enduring aspirations and anxieties. Angazhan represents power, dominance, and destruction, just as Grandmother Spider forms the foundation for oral traditions. Walkena's undead existence drives home the narrative of outside invaders, feeding the fears of foreign exploitation. Here the gods are not so much the source of animal strength, cleverness, or hate so much as a means of personifying and translating those concepts, and anyone who would understand the Expanse's people would do well to study their faiths.",
						"Yet the gods are also very real. Supernatural haunts and beasts are proof of their influence and reason enough to offer prayers for protection. Celestials and fiends alike enact their patrons' will in the material world. Even priests perform minor miracles on a daily basis, driving home that the divine are as powerful and worthy of awe as ever. However, for all the deities' cosmic importance, their role in most Mwangi societies takes on a humbler role, treated in everyday parlance more like eccentric relatives or disquieting neighbors whom it's best not to rouse than omnipotent beings\u2014all the more so, given some groups' genealogies identifying one or more gods as distant ancestors. Unwelcome rain might be cause to chide Gozreh aloud, and on hot days far from Mzali, someone might reprimand Walkena that this is no time to play with fire. Elsewhere it's high praise at the end of a tale to tease a talented storyteller as if she were Grandmother Spider masquerading in mortal form, mock-scolding her for ignoring earlier prayers.",
						"This behavior stems partly from desensitization to the supernatural; magic is so prevalent in the Expanse it can seem at times mundane. More importantly, though, this casual divine banter originates in the thousands of myths of the various gods tricking, fighting, thwarting, stealing from, and flirting with one another, immortalizing the gods' supposed exploits in a humbling light. The gods aren't aloof; they're present and approachable for any so bold as to call on them. Just so did Holomog's ancestors beseech the Empyreal Lords to negotiate the Celestial Concordance, and just so can anyone from lay person to priest petition the divine\u2014or hold their gods accountable. Nowhere is this better illustrated than Mzali, where the god Walkena walks among the same people who a century earlier deemed their three sun gods complacent and cast the trio aside.",
						"For all the power they bring, these pacts are binding. Walkena shelters Mzali's people yet demands supplication. Angazhan grants strength at the cost of control. Even Holomog's celestial obedience carries strictures its citizens can't easily ignore. Here the favored faiths remain at their strongest, often from sincere reverence but sometimes because any hint of blasphemy invites severe punishment.",
						"Yet even these more demanding faiths are the exception rather than the rule. Most areas celebrate a host of divinities, from familiar gods to more obscure, local patrons. Senghor's reverence of Abadar coexists with strong Gozren faith. Kibwe is awash with hundreds of Zenj household deities imported by traders from across the Expanse. Bloodcove's longtime connection to the Shackles has provided a foothold for Besmara's clerics, even as many inhabitants have become desensitized to thieves smuggling out sacred relics from inland faiths. Even in Nantambu, where Jatembe's millennia-old magical traditions offer a compelling alternative to divine power, shrines to Shelyn, Irez, Nethys, and more find homes.",
						"At its core, faith is like so much else in the Mwangi Expanse: a diverse, ageless, occasionally dangerous reflection of its history and people, all too often misunderstood by outside observers."

When the Material Plane was born, the benevolent elemental lords seeded it with all the potential of their elements, creating planets, stars, oceans, and life. Yet as mortality evolved, it began harnessing the elements for malevolent purposes, causing anguished dissent between the benevolent elemental lords and emboldening their evil counterparts. Kelizandri, the fearsome lord of water, forged an alliance with the other evil elemental lords\u2014 Ayrzul, Hshurha, and Ymeri\u2014to seal each good elemental lord in a prison penetrable only by combining the other three elemental powers once more; this feat has been achieved only once in the ages since.

While all empyreal lords are dedicated to good, their philosophies, interests, and personalities vary, and they don't always agree with one another.",

Most worship takes place at small shrines, statues, or artifacts (such as the sculpture known as the Mistress of Angels in Magnimar), or simply through the doing of deeds that reflect an empyreal lord's interest or beliefs. Centers of worship like churches or cathedrals are extremely uncommon. Most followers consider worship to be an individual matter, and it is rare to see a follower of any empyreal lord proselytizing. However, adherents sometimes congregate in small groups called mystery cults, and some of these groups maintain small temples. The city of Magnimar is home to several mystery cults, as the Varisian people have long held the empyreal lords in high esteem. It is not uncommon for mystery cultists to worship multiple empyreal lords in various combinations, or even all of them, though most have a favorite patron.",

At the GM's discretion, champions and clerics can dedicate themselves to a pantheon. In such cases, the characters still worship a specific patron deity among those in the pantheon, but also follow the edicts and anathema of the pantheon as a whole. A character who worships a pantheon this way can gain the domains, alternate domains, and spells from the pantheon instead of those from their patron deity. They must uphold the ideals of both their patron deity and the pantheon, though the patron deity's edicts and anathema take precedence. For example, a worshipper of Iomedae could worship the Godclaw, but they wouldn't take the tyranny domain, as it would be in conflict with Iomedae's edicts.

Of course, the saying also leaves little room for doubt about the steps to be taken after.}"

Her intervention is widely known to inflict corruptions and terrible nightmares. Ostracized individuals who share her ideals will find this intervention a boon, while others treat similar events as horrible curses. Above all else, Lamashtu desires the proliferation, permeation, and dominance of her children. Her touch upon the mortal world reveals the repugnant flaws among those considered to be beautiful and moral.

Psychopomp servants of Pharasma guide and safeguard newly dead souls along the River of Souls to her realm, where she judges each soul and ensures it is sent to the proper plane for its afterlife, according to its alignment and mortal deeds. Although she can see all possible fates and knows the fate of each individual, free will and choice can alter a soul's final destination, and she places great weight on the individual's actions and personal choices.

While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag's areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deeprooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves' impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one's work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag's oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was longestablished even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation."

While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others' expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira's followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. Chaldira is most often depicted as a halfling woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons."

											"The Eldest of loneliness, sadness, and forgotten things, the Lost Prince spends most of his time brooding in the throne room of his crumbling tower. Although his precise origin is a hotly debated issue, the Lost Prince is known to hail from a place other than the First World. The melancholy lord doesn't speak of his home, and in fact he doesn't speak much at all, as he's prone to bouts of depression powerful enough to leach color from his surroundings and press his coterie of followers into respectful silence. Appearing as a gaunt, pale human man dressed in black finery, the Lost Prince bears vivid red runes on his brow and on the backs of his hands. He is studiously neutral in the schemes of the other Eldest, which makes his opinions and his favor particularly valuable."

He is a serious and stern figure draped in silvery robes that swish around his legs as he walks lonely and distant paths. No carefree wanderer, Ng is a patron of those who travel long distances with purpose, and he sometimes shields them from banditry, treacherous weather, and getting lost. Ng keeps many secrets, even from his followers, and none know what his evidently aimless travels might portend. Ng rules over the seasons as they turn one into another, but he rules far more numerous seasons than the four familiar to Golarion, such as the Season of Carnivorous Light and the Season of Solemn Deliquescence."

											"Korada, the Open Hand of Harmony, is concerned with foresight, forgiveness, and peace. In particular, he believes that although the tireless fight against wickedness is admirable, the ultimate triumph over evil will come in the form of redemption rather than destruction. Korada's dedication to peace is such that he and his followers refuse to cause harm to their attackers, instead using their martial skills only to defend themselves. Many Koradans seek greater wisdom through study or meditation in hopes of better understanding their foes so as to guide them toward redemption. This dedication to self-awareness, philosophy, and introspection is said to have allowed Korada greater insight into the workings of the universe, granting him the great gift of foresight. Korada rarely acts on his visions, however, believing the struggle that comes with true change is always worthwhile, whether or not such a change is successful."

Closer inspection reveals that their body is made from interlacing strands of poetic protean script. Ydajisk is also called the Mother of Tongues, though like all proteans, their gender changes as they will. Followers of Ydajisk are wanderers, reviving dead languages from ancient ruins, chronicling the dying tongues of cultures in decline, and discovering or inventing new words. All such knowledge acquired by agents of the Mother of Tongues passes into Ydajisk's realm, the Library of Stolen Words, where it is transcribed into books or stored in magical containers, alongside scrolls and tomes considered long lost by mortal scholars."

											"Based in Ustalav but active in aristocratic salons and cloistered academies across Avistan and Garund, the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye is a mystic order of occultist-nobles who seek philosophical self-awareness and mastery of celestial truths. The order was founded in 3988 ar when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts\u2014both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter\u2014has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 ar. The Esoteric Order's meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened. The order's greatest accomplishment, however, was averting a doomsday few on Golarion will ever realize was imminent: in 4718 ar, the order's greatest heroes prevented the planet Aucturn from devouring Golarion."

The philosophy often influences their methods of worship, with Abadarans keeping careful records of their wealth or even investing money for a future incarnation, and Pharasmins beseeching the psychopomp bureaucracy to look favorably upon their deeds in life and shepherd their future selves to enlightenment. Some worshippers of malicious deities follow a twisted version of Sangpotshi, seeking to extend their existences through undeath and using the time gained to perfect their stations in this incarnation. Most adherents of the traditional teachings, by contrast, consider undead to be prisons for souls that lock them away from the cycle of fate and reincarnation, and destroy undead wherever they can be found."
