				"Prior to the Evisceration of 4707, the district of V'drysha was a lovely borough on the southern edge of Ecanus. Now, it's the Awful, a vast morass of spell-resistant flesh and sinew, ever threatening to engulf the city. You were once a Scab working to push back its influence. It's a nasty, dangerous job, and poorly paid as well, but at least you learned enough to mimic a viscerasuit, the enchanted, airtight suit that protected you from the poisons and plagues of the Awful.",

During your daily preparations, you can seal your outfit. The first time each day you are introduced to {@trait poison} or {@trait disease} without taking physical damage, the sealed outfit attempts to {@quickref counteract||3|counteracting} it using your Medicine modifier as the counteract modifier."
