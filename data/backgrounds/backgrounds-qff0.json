When you came upon the Broken Tusk following, you determined you'd finally found a people whose values and traditions made you feel whole again. The Broken Tusk was supposedly once a much bigger following, and so you've joined them in the hopes of helping them heal old wounds and rebuild in the shadow of loss. In the process, perhaps this new family will help you do the same.",
