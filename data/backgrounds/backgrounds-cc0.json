As a result, you've come to expect being overlooked, and that's helped to shape your worldview. Maybe you take advantage of this to get away with things that no one would suspect you of, or perhaps it has encouraged you to focus on your training and become even better at what you do. Nothing's worked, exactly, but that's just left you with more time to watch and learn how everyone else behaves, which has given you greater insights into the societies that always seem to forget about you. You've studied the rules of countless games and competitions so that you're always ready to capitalize on a technicality to make up for being regarded as a weak link. When you do succeed at a task, it's often to the surprise of observers, and it's happened enough by now that there are those who, perhaps as a result of also always being chosen last, have come to view you as an inspiration to look up to.","Choose two ability boosts.

Perhaps your parents were actors or directors, or maybe you fell in with a theater crowd at a young age. Perhaps you and your siblings shared a tradition of putting on plays for your parents or, if you were an only child, maybe you directed your toys and stuffed animals in elaborate productions that played out in your mind. Whatever the case, as you grew older, you found that you were most comfortable helping to organize and facilitate the goals and dreams of others—and not just in the role of being a director for a stage production. You've always derived satisfaction from being the one in charge of something and helping others get organized so as to accomplish something significant. Yet for whatever reason, this never quite grew into your job; you've never actually made money directing, or if you have, it was never enough to allow you to abandon your other responsibilities. Still, the experience you've gained at this amateur work has given you some impressive skills and self-confidence.","Choose two ability boosts.

It's likely that you've got a significant talent for creating artwork yourself, but at the very least, you grew up in a home, neighborhood, or city where artwork was freely available for you to enjoy. The first time you met someone who hadn't had this luxury was a shock, and you promised yourself that you would do whatever you could to bring the joy of artwork to places and people unfortunate enough to be bereft of it. Of course, original art isn't always something that can be transported, so you've settled on the next best thing—teaching others about art, art history, and artistic theory. Whether you've made money by teaching others about art or taken it upon yourself to altruistically educate others, the only thing that approaches the feeling of euphoria you receive from admiring or creating a new piece of art is what you gain by spreading this appreciation to others.","Choose two ability boosts.
