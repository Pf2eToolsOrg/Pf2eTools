					"{@b Strike up the Band} ({@trait auditory}, {@trait illusion}) For 1 minute, you are followed by orchestral theme music tied to the emotional content of the actions you're performing. This grants you a +2 status bonus to {@skill Diplomacy}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Performance} checks, a \u20132 status penalty to {@skill Deception} checks, and makes certain uses of {@skill Stealth} virtually impossible. It might have other effects as the GM sees fit."

All creatures in a 40-foot burst gain resistance to all damage equal to double the surge's spell level for up to 1 minute. Whenever a creature applies this resistance, the resistance for all affected creatures reduces by 1. The effect ends for all creatures when it reduces to 0."

For 1 minute, attempt a DC {@flatDC 11} flat check at the start of each of your turns. On a success, you gain a +2 status bonus to all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks; on a failure, you take a \u20132 status penalty to them instead."
