On a critical success, the character also learns something subtler, like a demon's weakness or the trigger for one of the creature's reactions.",
								"The skill used to identify a creature usually depends on that creature's trait, as shown on Table 10\u20137, but you have leeway on which skills apply. For instance, hags are humanoids but have a strong connection to occult spells and live outside society, so you might allow a character to use {@skill Occultism} to identify them without any DC adjustment, while Society is harder. Lore skills can also be used to identify their specific creature. Using the applicable Lore usually has an easy or very easy DC (before adjusting for rarity).",
