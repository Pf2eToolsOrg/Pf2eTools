								"The Wild Shape feature in the player's handbook lets you transform into a beast that you've seen. That rule gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility, making it easy to amass an array of beast form options for yourself, but you must abide by the limitations in the Beast Shapes table in that book.",
								"When you gain Wild Shape as a 2nd-level druid, you might wonder which beasts you've already seen. The following tables organize beasts from the monster manual according to the beasts' most likely environments. Consider the environment your druid grew up in, then consult the appropriate table for a list of animals that your druid has probably seen by 2nd level.",
								"These tables can also help you and your DM determine which animals you might see on your travels. In addition, the tables include each beast's challenge rating and note whether a beast has a flying or swimming speed. This information will help you determine whether you qualify to assume that beast's form.",
								"The tables include all the individual beasts that are eligible for Wild Shape (up to a challenge rating of 1) or the Circle Forms feature of the Circle of the Moon (up to a challenge rating of 6).",
