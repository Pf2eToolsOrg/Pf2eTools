Plant eidolons tend to be curious and adaptable, with temperaments based on the parts of mortal culture they feel affinity toward. Despite coming from the same source, plant eidolons don't always look like leshys. Plant eidolons have forms that vary greatly and can look like almost any kind of plant creature in existence. Some even resemble plant creatures so strange they are impossible to identify.",
