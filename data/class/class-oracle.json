If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish {@action Cast a Spell||Casting the Spell}. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you {@action Refocus} while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.",

Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't {@action Cast a Spell||Cast} or {@action Sustain a Spell||Sustain} any revelation spells\u2014you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still {@action Refocus} to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.",
						"Your curse has the {@trait curse}, {@trait divine}, and {@trait necromancy} traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than {@action Refocus|CRB|Refocusing} and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as true strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, remove curse and similar spells don't affect your curse at all."
