Thick, white fur covers everywhere except his face, hands, and feet, which reveal darker skin beneath the fur, covered in an intricate pattern of stylized runes. Unlike other saumen kar, Ainamuuren possess not two but four long, curving horns, jutting from his head like a primal crown. The large, magical greataxe he carries bears intricate, stylized runic patterns that greatly resemble those carved upon his flesh, with the same sharp focus on angular lines and triangular shapes."

Cuetzmonquali is capable of growing any number of horns from its head, on which it can impale and trap its enemies. Each horn grows in a burst of searing flame that burns flesh and scales and results in a blackened obsidian spike jutting from its forehead. These horns molt off occasionally, leaving behind warnings of the beast's presence.",
						"In combat, Cuetzmonquali is a terrifying foe who uses its horns to skewer foes, unleashes white-hot blasts of flame to devastate those who don't approach, and injects a potent burning venom that ignites a foe from within their own body, sapping their strength. Against groups of weaker foes, it simply tramples them to death underfoot. Anyone courageous enough to face Cuetzmonquali and powerful or cunning enough to slay the creature can lay claim to the treasure that lies in its belly: the legendary artifact known as the {@item Spear of the Destroyer's Flame|LOMM}."

As such, {@item holy water} and other measures that might be effective against fiends have no effect on Desert's Howl.",

Over time, its proportions lengthened and grew, as did its frightening abilities and appetite for suffering.",
						"Given the incredible range on Desert's Howl's namesake desolate exclamation, creatures are much more likely to hear Desert's Howl than see it. Though such forewarning potentially gives distant creatures additional time to prepare to face or escape the creature, Desert's Howl enjoys the steady build-up of fear that this approach allows, potentially breaking its victims' resolve long before it even appears. Besides, a creature of its power has little to fear from travelers, or even most adventurers, regardless of how much time they have to prepare. In the end, a greater struggle just makes destroying them all the sweeter.",

On subsequent nights, dreams and reality can begin to blur together due to exhaustion, leaving the victim delirious and unable to discern upon waking whether the things they remember truly happened or not. At this point, Desert's Howl can use its illusions to bring to life things the victim saw in their dreams to unsettle them and sow distrust among their allies—perhaps glimpses of their companions acting suspiciously or strange omens and portents carried over from their nightmares."

						"As discussed on page 165 of {@i Bestiary 2}, female linnorms lay eggs in the wilderness, where linnorms are known to hunt. A linnorm egg remains viable for many years, protected by a tough, leathery skin easily mistaken for stone. When a male linnorm eventually stumbles across the egg, he fertilizes it and takes it to a secure and remote location, leaving it alone to eventually hatch. Newborn linnorms remain hidden in their nests for several months as they mature, growing large enough to hunt on their own and setting out into the world. These linnorms are roughly the equivalent of older teenagers when compared to other species. Younger linnorms, while still primal creatures with a strong tie to the {@plane First World}, haven't yet manifested most of their magical powers. They still can't breathe deadly fire or lightning or see invisible creatures, and, most importantly, they can be slain without prompting the linnorm's legendary death curse. They do, however, have voracious appetites, consuming any living thing to fuel their rapid growth. A linnorm is most vulnerable during this time; scouts who find tracks of a young linnorm quickly muster a hunting party of stalwart and experienced warriors to track the creature down and kill it quickly—before they draw the attention of the linnorm's father.",

While ordinary lions rely on stealth and pack tactics to secure a meal, the grisantian lion is too big to hide in tall grass. Instead, it has adapted to the mountains, where it selects a large and hard-to-reach cave as its home before claiming it from whatever creature is so unfortunate as to already inhabit the place. A grisantian lion is a canny hunter, able to track for miles, and remains behind rocky cliffs and outcroppings as it approaches its prey. Once close enough, it pounces, tearing open the prey's armor and shredding the flesh within. If threatened, a grisantian lion seizes its meal in its mouth and leaps off, scaling a nearby cliff face and retreating to its den.",
