								"In an interesting twist to the pest's life cycle, some spellcasters incorporate giant silverfish moltings into their spellbooks and scrolls. These shed skins have the consistency of onionskin and are valuable due to the superstition that they contain residual magic from texts the silverfish consumed. Regardless of whether a silverfish molt has any intrinsic magical power, many tenured mages feel that proof of a book-devouring vermin's demise is worthy of a reward. Thus, such a trophy is guaranteed to fetch a tidy sum from the right buyer."

Any group of creatures large enough to sustain multiple tsetse flies, such as a herd of dinosaurs, are quite likely to dominate the surrounding ecosystem on their own right.",
						"A single giant tsetse fly can kill an entire herd of large animals within a few weeks, and those they don't kill often succumb to disease. When not hunting, giant tsetse flies prefer to hide in warm, dark places in forests and swamps, though they sometimes inhabit wet cave systems where prey is plentiful. The thrumming drone of their wings echoes around such cave systems, warning travelers familiar with the noise that the creatures are lairing nearby.",
						"If food becomes scarce, a giant tsetse fly relocates elsewhere. They tend to follow rivers, animal tracks, or even roads to find food. This can take them to the fringes of civilization, where farms and ranches often have livestock that draws their attention. Settlers who find evidence of a giant tsetse fly should quickly seek out help to eliminate the pests, as all their animals (and, indeed, their families) are in jeopardy as long as the hungry insect is near.",

Giant tsetse flies might therefore be put to use as guardians or even mounts, but any potential trainer must take care not to become the voracious insect's next meal."

Takulu responds to these rumors as he does most things, with an understanding smile and a well-considered statement. Those who aren't hung up on Takulu's seemingly inhuman reserves of patience often appreciate the teacher for his willingness to treat his students as the young adults they are, empowering their efforts and ensuring they can always pursue what they feel is right.",

Whereas many of the Magaambya's teachers provide hands-on lessons mainly to advance a relevant research project or simply due to the day's whim, Takulu has spent much of his time researching how best to convey information to others. He's particularly focused on teaching those who lack formal education, as they arrive without a framework for scholarly learning. Though his ideas have gotten some interest from others on campus, other teachers are uncertain how much of Takulu's success stems from his methods and how much stems from his even temperament."
