								"In an interesting twist to the pest's life cycle, some spellcasters incorporate giant silverfish moltings into their spellbooks and scrolls. These shed skins have the consistency of onionskin and are valuable due to the superstition that they contain residual magic from texts the silverfish consumed. Regardless of whether a silverfish molt has any intrinsic magical power, many tenured mages feel that proof of a book-devouring vermin's demise is worthy of a reward. Thus, such a trophy is guaranteed to fetch a tidy sum from the right buyer."

The thrumming drone of their wings echoes around such cave systems, warning travelers familiar with the noise that the creatures are lairing nearby.",

This can take them to the fringes of civilization, where farms and ranches often have livestock that draws their attention.

As a gremlin\u2014a category of mischievous, malevolent fey\u2014Kurshkin has spent most of her life with no real motives beyond childish cruelty. Like most pugwampi gremlins, Kurshkin delights in the misfortune of others, and especially enjoying making bad situations worse by introducing wasps, bleach, or other humiliating and painful substances to a situation where people are already suffering.",
						"After decades of tormenting workers and artists on the outskirts of Nantambu, several members of the squabbling collective of gremlins that Kurshkin was a part of developed a grudge against one of the youths that often helped out around the city\u2014an obnoxiously mellow and good-humored young man named Takulu Ot. The young man was a student at the Magaambya with a terrible habit of helping people keep a positive attitude in bad circumstances. In a display of uncharacteristic boldness, the gremlins ventured into the academy to enact their revenge on the youth and the entire school. They knew that historically, gremlins tended to eschew the academy, but they didn't know why. Kurshkin, in particular, considered herself far too clever to have anything to fear at the Magaambya. After all, the academy only held people, and people are fun to torment.",
						"Unsurprisingly, the gremlins found they had bitten off more than they could chew in deciding to take on a university filled with mages. Kurshkin was one of the first \"casualties\" of the offensive\u2014caught by a deft student, the pugwampi was stuffed in a sack, loaded onto an elephant, and was two weeks of travel away from Nantambu before she managed to chew her way out of her confinement.",
						"By the time Kurshkin made it back to the Magaambya, all of her fellow gremlins were dead.",
						"Though the pugwampi's first impulse was to run and hide, she was also paranoid that the killer would be coming for her next. Kurshkin began to spy on the campus, looking for any sign of a continued threat. In her vigil, she found herself paying attention to some of the magical lessons being taught at the school. After years of inadvertent osmosis, she even managed to develop a few new magical tricks of her own.",
						"The Magaambya's philosophy of understanding others and overcoming differences worked in Kurshkin's favor. If a few teachers or staff members noticed a creature that would skitter off when spotted, and seemed to be doing no harm, they said nothing about it. Kurshkin's caution eventually waned to the point where she would risk a few pranks on students, but her fear of attracting attention meant these tricks were all effectively harmless, and many of the scholars considered the gremlin's mischief to be a good lesson to teach students some care. Whether or not this situation would have remained tenable on its own is debatable, but it unraveled as soon as the being known as Stone Ghost reached out to Kurshkin.",
						"A strange creature that manifested from the rock of the Magaambya's walls, Stone Ghost was recruiting gremlins for his schemes against the university. He originally approached Kurshkin as a kindred spirit, promising a chance at revenge. When Kurshkin refused, citing what had happened to her own vengeful comrades, Stone Ghost revised his offer: obey, or Stone Ghost would kill her.",
						"It quickly became apparent that Kurshkin was somehow the most competent among Stone Ghost's gathered gremlins, and she was happy to take the leadership position and heap abuse on her underlings. A firm believer in leading from the back, Kurshkin obeys Stone Ghost's orders by telling her fellows what to do while she remains safe and sound, far away from any blowback their malicious antics might incur.",
						"Like most pugwampis, Kurshkin resembles a dog that has lost most of its fur to mange. Her head is too big for her body, and her eyes nearly seem to be popping out of their sockets. She has large, floppy ears but is mostly deaf. During her time at the Magaambya, her eyes have turned bright blue in color\u2014a quirk that her fellow gremlins both mock and fear. Her clothing is unusually fine for a gremlin, due to her scavenging from the Magaambya's well-to-do students, and has become somewhat vain and fussy about what she wears.

If her enemies seem too competent, she's happy to abandon her subordinates to her foes' whims so that she can flee to safety.",
								"Kurshkin is a petty sort of evil, the kind that delights in causing others misfortune because she thinks it's funny. While she's never done anything that warrants death by most human standards, it's undeniable that her presence and actions make people miserable and situations worse.",
								"Her dislike of deadly violence is mainly due to cowardice and the fact that she finds corpses to be less entertaining than living victims. This doesn't mean she won't stick a sword on someone who makes her mad by spoiling her fun; she's done so many times before, and likely will again. Even if the heroes deal with Kurshkin without lethal measures, she still endeavors to slowly grind down everyone around her, one minor annoyance at a time."

To the professors at the academy, Uduak was an obvious candidate for the school's education. He easily found a sponsor and was set upon his Perquisite to become a full-fledged attendant.",

Feeling that he was meant to be building his own skills at the academy, he felt resentful about the community service he felt was being forced upon him. He performed his tasks with little effort and little concern for the people he was supposedly helping. Cracks began to form in his mild demeanor, and he increasingly drew reprimands for acts of carelessness or petty cruelty. Everything came to a head when his cohort was tasked with removing a group of pugwampi gremlins that had started causing mischief within the academy walls. Ignoring the spirited discussions of his fellow initiates, Uduak used his magic to slaughter the gremlins like vermin.",

It was the last straw in a long series of misdeeds, but the young man fixated on this one event, enraged that the school would rob him of his future over defending himself and his classmates from a group of mere pests. In his anger, he lashed out violently at the school and the teachers. His magic bounced off the ancient wards of the Magaambya like a pebble off a cliff, and the professors temporarily confined Uduak until the administration could decide what to do with him. Left to stew in his own resentment, Uduak ignored his guard's warning, drew on all of his strength, and attempted to shatter the spells that kept him imprisoned within his room.",

Yet magic is never entirely predictable\u2014or perhaps the murdered pugwampis got one last scrap of revenge. In an incredibly unlikely reaction, the Magaambya's wards rebounded onto Uduak with the full force of their power. So far as any teacher at the school could tell, this reaction evaporated Uduak on the spot.",
						"The student that was Uduak was not gone, however, but found himself merged with the Magaambya's stone walls. The same wards that originally trapped him within the buildings now protected him from detection, and Uduak decided to use this to his advantage. He hid himself in an abandoned section of the school and began planning his vengeance. His first recruits to his cause were an assorted group of gremlins that snuck into the school with no clue as to the recent massacre of their kind. Through a series of promises and threats, the cursed student took command of the gremlins, considering it fitting that the initiators of his downfall would now serve him against the teachers who had so wronged him. The gremlins, impressed and fearful of their new leader's ability to move through stone walls, granted him a new moniker: Stone Ghost.",
						"Stone Ghost resembles a young man with a body made out of chunks of stone, his faceted skin matching the blocks that make up the Magaambya campus. His hair and face are made of ruined mosaics, and his body is covered in fragmentary runes: the shattered remains of the magic wards that caused his current condition.

Recognizing their son would never be happy where he was, stifled in both mind and spirit, Takulu's parents invoked a different tradition\u2014a gift of a sacred ibis went to the Empyreal scholars, and Takulu went to the Magaambya.",
						"Takulu had a considerate and kind nature even as a youth, and he immediately took to the Magaambyan ideals of responsibility and community service. He impressed his teachers with his thoughtfulness and his almost-supernatural levels of calm when dealing with difficult situations. His friendly and accepting demeanor meant that Takulu often found himself making friends with the unpopular or less successful students, helping them overcome bullying, shyness, and other social challenges to excel. These efforts found him surrounded by loyal friends and grateful acquaintances as he advanced his academic career. A year after achieving Conversant rank, he married his wife, a talented glass artist living in Nantambu; their relationship remains quietly happy and unshakable to this day.",
						"For over a decade, he was content, and this was enough. Yet as Takulu watched the next generation of Magaambya initiates work their way through their studies, he began to realize his beloved academy had flaws. The school was incredibly understanding of different methods of learning, but could be callous when it came to supporting students emotionally. The self-directed studies that had offered Takulu the freedom to pursue his own interests allowed similarly self-directed and ambitious students to flourish but left those less certain of their path in life adrift and lost. The Magaambya's teachers maintained informal schedules and often forced students to seek them out, considering the journey a valuable lesson, yet this method actively favored those with more social confidence. Recognizing that talented youths were being left behind by the Magaambya's practices, Takulu turned his research to a field that had often taken second place to other academic concerns at the university\u2014the study of teaching itself.",
						"Like many subjects at the Magaambya, several scholars had dabbled in this research, but their knowledge had never been aggregated or catalogued. Takulu began the slow process of testing these approaches and adding his own refinements. He volunteered to personally teach many of the new initiates, a task that was usually left up to older students. The scholar also continued to tutor students that failed to thrive, doing what he could to learn the best methods of organizing lessons to help the most people learn.",
						"Imparting his knowledge to the rest of the Magaambya has been slow. Teachers who thrived under the self-guided tutelage of their mentors prefer things to remain as they are. Others approve of Takulu's goals but consider the implementation a project for him and his like-minded students, rather than something to be broadly embraced. For now, Takulu has satisfied his ambitions by making himself a resource to a generation of incoming initiates and by keeping notes on his process and observations with the same precision that he applies to all of his scholarly pursuits.",
						"In addition to his knowledge of magic and mathematics, Takulu is a skilled diplomat, as he deals with irate students and reticent academics on a daily basis. He's also a very capable mbira player. When not teaching, he can be found watching birds on campus or out in the city of Nantambu, where he's usually accompanied by his wife.",
						"Physically, Takulu is an average-looking man with a friendly smile. He wears clothing with crisp patterns and happy colors, which somehow never have a wrinkle on them no matter what the teacher has been doing recently. He has a favored wooden staff that he almost always carries with him\u2014a gift from a student, which sometimes sprouts a tiny fruit or attracts a brave songbird\u2014and also carries or wears a small trinket in the shape of an anteater, as he has a well-known and innocent delight for the animals. His wholesome image often causes students to gossip about him, making up conspiracy theories of violent hobbies or a secret dark past, but there's no truth to these haphazard stories. Takulu really is everything he appears to be.",

								"Takulu is the first impression of the Magaambya that this campaign offers, serving as a kindly mentor to the heroes while they are students and a reliable ally to them after they outgrow his guidance. Even-tempered and unbearably kind, Takulu can offer advice and help to heroes who are struggling, including being a mouthpiece for you to provide suggestions to players who are struggling to find their character's role in the campaign. Although he answers to Takulu when faculty members speak to him, he prefers that students call him \"Teacher Ot.\" When not teaching, he can usually be found in his office on the top floor of the Heron Archives.",
								"If placed into a dangerous situation, Takulu's first goal is to protect his students, then anyone else in the area who requires assistance. He isn't a violent man, nor is he very good at violence even if he tries, meaning any combat aid he might offer in the course of the Adventure Path is firmly relegated to a support role."

						"Takulu is a kindly Magaambya scholar who takes it upon himself to make all new students feel welcome. He's so kindly that some students have a hard time believing he's genuine, in fact. In any given semester, rumors abound that the professor is a secret serial murder, an ex-soldier responsible for the deaths of hundreds, or possessed of a secretly violent hobby in order to channel his rage. Takulu responds to these rumors as he does most things, with an understanding smile and a well-considered statement. Those who aren't hung up on Takulu's seemingly inhuman reserves of patience often appreciate the teacher for his willingness to treat his students as the young adults they are, empowering their efforts and ensuring they can always pursue what they feel is right.",
						"In addition to his love of mathematics, Takulu is one of the few professors who puts just as much scholarly emphasis on the study of teaching. Whereas many of the Magaambya's teachers provide hands-on lessons mainly to advance a relevant research project or simply due to the day's whim, Takulu has spent much of his time researching how best to convey information to others. He's particularly focused on teaching those who lack formal education, as they arrive without a framework for scholarly learning. Though his ideas have gotten some interest from others on campus, other teachers are uncertain how much of Takulu's success stems from his methods and how much stems from his even temperament."
