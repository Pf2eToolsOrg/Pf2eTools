If a creature fails its save, it is shunted into the future, vanishing now but automatically reappearing in the same location after {@dice 1d4} rounds. A creature can attempt an additional Will save at the end of each of its turns to end the duration. If its original space is occupied when it returns, the creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space. Since the creature is shunted forward in time, it doesn't experience any of the intervening time. Likewise, any effects on the creature with a duration don't decrease their duration, resuming when the creature reappears.",

On a failed save, the creature receives a brief vision of a deeply traumatic event that lurks among the many possibilities of its future. The creature is {@condition frightened 2} ({@condition frightened 4} on a critical failure) and {@condition slowed 1} while they are {@condition frightened}."
