The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you and repeats a basic single action the target took since the end of your last turn, such as making a {@action Strike} or {@action Interact||Interacting} to pull a lever. Because the other basic single actions don't produce much of a result on their own, this is typically used for {@action Strike} and {@action Interact}, though occasionally it could be useful to have a temporal twin {@action Stride} through a potentially dangerous area to expose a hazard. The target ally spends a reaction to create the duplicate, makes any decisions, and rolls for the repeated action, such as choosing a target for a {@action Strike} and making the attack roll. If the ally doesn't have a reaction to spend, temporal twin fails. Use the duplicate's location for determining flanking, cover, and the like. Using this spell requires remembering what your ally did, and if you don't remember the details, the GM might not allow you to cast temporal twin.",
