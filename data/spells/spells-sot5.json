Any creature that attempts to open the target container, or to open or pass through the target doorway without speaking the password must attempt a save as normal. The ward vanishes automatically once the spell's duration ends, but can be removed before then as if it were a magical trap, using your spell DC for both the {@skill Perception} check to notice it and {@skill Thievery} check to disable it. Both checks require the creature attempting them to have expert proficiency in order to succeed. You can {@action Dismiss} temporal ward.
