The shards automatically block physical ranged attacks the size of a spear or smaller, such as arrows, bolts, and javelins. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against attacks with larger ranged weapons. Any spell that targets you requires the caster to succeed at a counteract check against your spell DC, or it fails to affect you."
