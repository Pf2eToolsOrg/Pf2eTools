This allows you to cool a drink, make a hot pot safe to handle, or other, similar minor effects. Once cooled, the object's temperature is subject to its environment as usual. You can also solidify ambient moisture into a solid object; this temporary object is of negligible Bulk, made of non-magical ice.
