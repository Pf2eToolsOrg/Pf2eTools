Traditionally, the people of the Linnorm Kingdoms fought against the cruel specter of hunger by taking to the seas in their distinctive longships, engaging in violent coastal raids along Avistan's extensive western coastline in order to secure valuable plunder and supplies. As the centuries wore on and the lands to the south grew more heavily populated, more organized, and thus more dangerous to raid, many of the Linnorm Kingdoms turned in their swords and shields for the tools of trade, and their long trips south sought to secure mercantile alliances rather than blood-won conquest. Yet some of the Kingdoms found such changes to tradition as dishonorable to their ancestors, and others simply preferred the act of raiding to the pursuit of trade. The harsh land and harsher winters are far from the only dangers in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Vast reaches of wilderness, ranging from rocky tundra to tangled forest to rugged hills, cut wide swaths between the settled reaches of the kingdoms, and in these lands dwell monsters. Capricious fey are common in these places, as are bloodthirsty trolls and murderous giants, strangely enchanted animals that can both plead for their lives and utter dire curses, and the unquiet spirits of the restless dead who haunt the places where they fell. The most dangerous are linnorms\u2014primordial dragons of vast size and great strength. Facing a linnorm in"
