Each pillar is 5 feet by 5 feet in length and width. The pillars must be conjured on a relatively flat area of natural earthen terrain such as sand, dirt, stone, or clay.

If the pillar would rise higher than the ceiling, it firmly abuts the ceiling but does not rise any higher. A creature caught between a pillar and a ceiling takes no damage (subject to GM discretion, such as is in the case of stalactites or other hazards) but becomes {@condition immobilized}. The creature can attempt an {@action Escape} check to free itself, but it must thereafter {@action Grab an Edge}, {@action Climb} down, or fall from the top of the pillar. The {@action Grab an Edge} and {@action Escape} DCs are the same as the Reflex save.",
