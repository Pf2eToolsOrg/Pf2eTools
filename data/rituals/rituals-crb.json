				"(expert); Secondary Checks {@skill Society} or {@skill Lore|Legal Lore} Range 10 feet; Target 1 creature of a level no greater than double the geas ritual's level Duration see text You enforce a magic rule on a willing target, forcing it to either perform or refrain from carrying out a certain act. A geas to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, \"Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.\" An unconditional geas to perform a certain act doesn't require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common geas to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, geas can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the geas, it becomes {@condition sickened|CRB|sickened 1}, and the {@condition sickened} condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the geas, to a maximum of {@condition sickened|CRB|sickened 4}. The {@condition sickened} condition ends immediately when it follows the geas again; it can't remove the {@condition sickened} condition in any other way.

Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by freedom. Some forms of imprisonment can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.",

Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the imprisonment ritual's spell level, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.",
						"{@bold Prison} You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.",
						"{@bold Slumber} (sleep effect) You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target\u2014whether romantically, filially, or otherwise\u2014frees it from the slumber. This form of imprisonment is also enchantment magic.",
						"{@bold Temporal Stasis} You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by {@trait any} effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of imprisonment, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a {@spell dispel magic} or {@spell haste} spell. This form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.",
						"{@bold Object} (9th level or higher) You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.",
						"{@bold Oubliette} (10th level only) You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the imprisonment occurred. Powerful magic such as wish can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-level freedom ritual can do so."
