Switching between the melee weapon usage and the firearm usage requires an {@action Interact} action. However, if your last action was a successful melee {@action Strike} against a foe using a combination weapon, you can make a firearm {@action Strike} with the combination weapon against that foe without fully switching to the firearm usage, firing the firearm just as you hit with the melee attack. In this case, the combination weapon returns to its melee usage after the firearm {@action Strike}.",

You can put a property rune on a combination weapon as long as it's appropriate for either of the two usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property rune's requirements, the effects of the property rune only apply for that usage. For instance, a {@item vorpal} {@group axe} musket only applies the {@item vorpal} property rune when you are using it as an {@group axe}.
