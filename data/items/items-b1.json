When a lich is destroyed, its soul flees to the phylactery. The phylactery then rebuilds the lich's undead body over the course of {@dice 1d10} days. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the phylactery, fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body). A lich's phylactery must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning. The standard phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment inscribed with magical phrases. This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more durable or difficult-to-obtain phylacteries. A phylactery might also come in the form of a ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the specifics are up to the creator"]}]}
