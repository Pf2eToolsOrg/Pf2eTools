				"The {@i Void Mirror} was created on a distant planet by a now-extinct alien cult to aid in unlocking the secrets of the Dark Tapestry. It appears as a 5-foot-tall, 2-footwide mirror of dark glass. As long as it's unmounted in a frame, the {@i Void Mirror} functions only as a mirror, save that it always reflects the sky as if it were night, regardless of the time of day. When the {@i Void Mirror} is mounted in a frame, it instead serves as a window into space, displaying a star field in its glass rather than a reflection. This frame can be of any quality, but stouter frames help to prevent the frame's destruction and thus help to keep the {@i Void Mirror} functional.",
				"The view presented by the {@i Void Mirror} is any view of the night sky possible from its current physical location, regardless of time of day. Observations of the sky in this way add a +3 item bonus to {@skill Lore||Astronomy Lore} or {@skill Perception} checks made while using the mirror. The point of view can be shifted through hand gestures, causing the scene within the mirror to reorient in any direction desired.",
				"A character who peers into the starscape within the {@i Void Mirror} must attempt a DC 41 Will save. On a failure, the character feels something looking back at them from the dark places between the stars. On a critical failure, this sensation causes the character to become {@condition frightened||frightened 1}. The character is then temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.",
				"By placing the {@i Void Mirror} in a specially-constructed frame (such as the one within the Cosmic Crypt in this adventure), it can halt the ongoing transformation of a creature that has performed the apotheosis activation. Building such a frame is beyond the skill of low-level characters, as it requires an artisan with legendary proficiency in {@skill Crafting}.",
				"The {@i Void Mirror} can be utilized in other ways, but before a character can activate these effects the occult methods to access these ritual-like effects must be {@action Research|GMG|Researched} separately. Since the specific methods for these activations vary slightly from person to person, these methods can't be taught; each person who seeks to activate the {@i Void Mirror} in one of the following ways must complete their own research to unlock the artifact's secrets. Each requires a separate number of {@skill Occultism} checks to {@action Research|GMG}, as detailed below for each activation.",

				"A {@i brain cylinder} allows the extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. As long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature remains alive and can continue to think, even though its body is dead. Detachable modules that fit into the base of the cylinder allow the brain to see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker. So long as these are attached, the brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, though nothing within the cylinder compels it to do so if it is unwilling. It also retains its living alignment, and can use Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills. A standard {@i brain cylinder} has one skill at +15, one at +13, and two at +11, as chosen by the GM.",

If a {@i brain cylinder} is destroyed, the brain dies and its soul finally moves on to the Boneyard. Restoring a brain in a {@i brain cylinder} to its former body can be done by any effect that restores life (and, in most cases, any capable of creating a new body, since the original is typically missing or long gone).",

A less powerful or more powerful brain can be placed in a {@i brain cylinder}, which can affect the {@i brain cylinder's} Perception, mental ability scores, Will save, and skill modifiers (and can drastically alter the value of the {@i brain cylinder}), but the physical properties of the {@i brain cylinder} remain unchanged. Higher-level {@i brain cylinders} can be crafted, with resistances and weaknesses increasing as appropriate to their level. However, they always have low AC and HP and terrible Fortitude and Reflex saves for a creature of the {@i brain cylinder's} level.",
				"You can open a {@i brain cylinder} by taking three consecutive actions with the {@trait manipulate} trait. If the {@i brain cylinder} contains a brain, the brain dies 3 rounds after it's removed or if the cylinder is left open for more than 10 minutes. You can transfer a brain from one {@i brain cylinder} to another with a DC 25 {@skill Medicine} (expert) or {@skill Occultism} (expert) check.
