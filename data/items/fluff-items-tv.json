						"In the millennia since Earthfall, Arcadian weaponsmiths have attempted time and again to replicate star guns, even going so far as to dismantle existing star guns to understand their design. Every attempt has failed, though one collaboration has yielded what many consider to be the closest result: spark guns. These guns have only a fraction\u2014a spark\u2014of the power of a star gun and make use of magical cores that collect and convert ambient energies into destructive bolts. The blasts fire from a gun like any bullet but instead take the form of small jets of fire, sonic pulses, or more bizarre discharges. Crafting a spark gun is a complicated magical process, knowledge of which remains relatively regional. As a result, spark guns are uncommon in the majority of Arcadia, though they're common in the Arcane Empires and Deadshot Lands regions. Spark guns are rare outside of Arcadia."
