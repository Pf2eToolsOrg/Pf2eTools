				"The memories and lessons that echo through the Tears of the Last Azlanti give clues about steps needed to destroy the artifact. After you have gained the power of each of the six aeon stones at least once, you are granted visions of six locations across Golarion. At each of these locations, you must replace one of the necklace's aeon stones with a {@item dull gray aeon stone}. Once the final stone is replaced, the powers of the necklace are drawn into its new stones. These stones become pieces of throneglass, and the chain and bails disintegrate."
