You can administer the suspension orally, {@action Activate an Item||Activating} the item as part of the same activity you use to {@action Treat Poison}. If you succeed at your {@skill Medicine} check to {@action Treat Poison} against an ingested poison, you can reduce the stage of the toxin by one stage, though this can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the poison entirely. If you do, the creature becomes {@condition sickened} 2 as its body purges the toxin. An artevil suspension doesn't work unless the poison was administered through ingestion; for instance, if a poison can be administered through either ingestion or injury and was administered through injury, the suspension won't work."
