				"Each of these unassuming sacks contains enough rotting fruit to provide a {@ancestry leshy|locg|fungus leshy|fungus} with 1 week's worth of rations, along with clusters of stones to help press out the fruit's juices. When you {@action Strike} a creature with a sack of rotten fruit, the sack is consumed while the creature takes {@damage 1d4} bludgeoning damage and must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is {@condition sickened||sickened 1}. The range increment of a thrown sack of rotten fruit is 20 feet."
