While electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years if kept well-fed."

The cryomister creates a burst with a radius depending on the type, making the affected area {@quickref difficult terrain||3|terrain} for 1 minute; , at the GM's discretion, however, this duration might be reduced in unusually hot conditions or increased in unusually cold ones. If an affected square takes fire damage, the {@quickref difficult terrain||3|terrain} is removed.

The ruby-eyed, leering devil's face that surrounds the barrel was intended to strike fear into the Countess's opponents\u2014of which there were many. Countess Tasya credited this weapon with her exceptional success in dueling circles and refused to name the weapon's creators for fear their works would fall into an opponent's hands. In the past decade, seven replicas of the Countess's famed pistol have arisen, each said to be crafted by the Countess's anonymous gunsmiths.",

Each pact-bound pistol was crafted not by a team of master artisans, but by Countess Tasya Iserav herself, a secret diabolist and devoted priestess of The Crimson Son. The very act of firing the weapon is an acceptance of the contract's terms and causes the weapon to fuse to you. Thereafter, the weapon reappears in your possessions within 1 minute of you discarding it, and can't be destroyed or thrown away permanently, until the curse is removed.",

The text appears one sentence at a time, from the beginning to the end and is written in Infernal. When the contract is fully scribed (see below), you no longer lose Hit Points when you attack a living creature.",

On a failure, their soul is consigned to the Archdevil {@deity Mephistopheles|LOGM}; their soul immediately goes to Hell and they can't be returned to life through any means short of divine intervention, a heist, or a successful appeal in the courts of Hell; even powerful magic such as wish is insufficient.",

You become immune to fire damage and the pact-bound pistol becomes a +2 striking greater fearsome dueling pistol. Your soul belongs to {@deity Mephistopheles|LOGM} and immediately goes to Hell when you die. You can't be returned to life through any means, even through the divine intervention of a deity.",

While you're fused with the pact-bound pistol, you can't reduce the value of your {@condition stupefied} condition except by damaging a living creature with it. Whenever you damage a living creature with it, if you are suffering from the {@condition stupefied} condition due to the pact-bound pistol, your {@condition stupefied} condition is removed."

				"This primitive device can be cobbled together from springs, wheels, and scrap and is commonly used to carry rocks or other dead weight forward to trigger traps. It can be loaded with up to 4 Bulk of items. Most creatures aren't small enough to fit on the cart, and even for Tiny creatures, it makes for a choppy ride; while riding the cart, a creature gains two actions at the start of each of its turns, instead of three. Once activated, the cart moves forward at a speed of 30 feet per round on your turn for up to 1 minute. If it strikes an obstruction, it attempts to continue its movement, pushing with an {@skill Athletics} bonus of +5, once per round. The wind-up cart has AC 15, Hardness 2, 24 Hit Points, and a Break Threshold of 12. After its 1-minute duration completes, the cart collapses back into scrap."
