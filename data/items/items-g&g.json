Each activation provides enough energy for 10 minutes of use, and the two feeding tanks combined carry enough prey animals for 50 activations before needing to be refilled, though electric eels usually need feeding only once per day, and won't go after the prey if they're all full. While electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years if kept well-fed."

Compared to a more traditional magically-assisted diving suit using a bottle of air, a clockwork diving suit is both less expensive and better protected, making clockwork diving suits a good choice for characters who prefer more protection. However, they also come with a built-in time limit, which magical diving suits circumvent.

To compensate for this, a clockwork water jet mechanism is installed in the suit's back. The water jet includes both a vacuum system and separate air bladder; it's activated with a simple pull of a lever on the suit's belt. When the lever is pulled, the vacuum system sucks in seawater, and seconds later, the air bladder sprays the water out and propels the user short distances.",

The user presses a button on the control stick to activate the light writer. Upon activation, magical light illuminates the tube, producing a steady light for 20 minutes. This light is captured by the lens and projected onto the metal plate, slowly creating an image of the scene in front of the lens. The plate can then be removed, allowing the image to be displayed anywhere the owner desires. The light writer is mounted on a tripod and must be perfectly still during operation to prevent any defects from appearing in the plate image.

				"Commissioned at great expense and artfully designed by a team of the finest gunsmiths, this exquisite mahogany pistol has adamantine detailing. The ruby-eyed, leering devil's face that surrounds the barrel was intended to strike fear into the Countess's opponents\u2014of which there were many. Countess Tasya credited this weapon with her exceptional success in dueling circles and refused to name the weapon's creators for fear their works would fall into an opponent's hands. In the past decade, seven replicas of the Countess's famed pistol have arisen, each said to be crafted by the Countess's anonymous gunsmiths.",
				"That each of these weapon's wielders have quickly risen to become exceptional duelists in their own right has lent credence to their claims. Despite public pressure, wielders of these replicas have refused to square off against the Countess.",
				"Despite the weapon's beauty and utility, a pact-bound pistol is a cursed weapon and a physical manifestation of an infernal contract sworn between the bearer of the weapon and the Archdevil {@deity Mephistopheles|LOGM}. Each pact-bound pistol was crafted not by a team of master artisans, but by Countess Tasya Iserav herself, a secret diabolist and devoted priestess of The Crimson Son. The very act of firing the weapon is an acceptance of the contract's terms and causes the weapon to fuse to you. Thereafter, the weapon reappears in your possessions within 1 minute of you discarding it, and can't be destroyed or thrown away permanently, until the curse is removed.",
				"Whenever you attack a living creature with the pact-bound pistol, text from the infernal contract is seared into your flesh, causing you to lose 1 Hit Point, or 2 Hit Points if the attack was a critical success. The text appears one sentence at a time, from the beginning to the end and is written in Infernal. When the contract is fully scribed (see below), you no longer lose Hit Points when you attack a living creature.",
				"These burned phrases heal over as scars which can't be removed while you are fused to the weapon, although they can be covered and disguised.",
				"Each time a creature dies within 1 hour of being damaged by a pact-bound pistol, that creature must attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw. On a failure, their soul is consigned to the Archdevil {@deity Mephistopheles|LOGM}; their soul immediately goes to Hell and they can't be returned to life through any means short of divine intervention, a heist, or a successful appeal in the courts of Hell; even powerful magic such as wish is insufficient.",
				"After you have consigned 9 souls to {@deity Mephistopheles|LOGM} in this way, the contract is fully scribed upon your flesh. You become immune to fire damage and the pact-bound pistol becomes a +2 striking greater fearsome dueling pistol. Your soul belongs to {@deity Mephistopheles|LOGM} and immediately goes to Hell when you die. You can't be returned to life through any means, even through the divine intervention of a deity.",
				"Failing to wield a pact-bound pistol is a breach of contract. Each day you go without firing the pact-bound pistol at a living creature, you must attempt a Will saving throw. On a failure, you become {@condition stupefied|CRB|stupefied 1}. If you are already {@condition stupefied}, the value of your {@condition stupefied} condition increases by 1, to a maximum of {@condition stupefied|CRB|stupefied 4}. While you're fused with the pact-bound pistol, you can't reduce the value of your {@condition stupefied} condition except by damaging a living creature with it. Whenever you damage a living creature with it, if you are suffering from the {@condition stupefied} condition due to the pact-bound pistol, your {@condition stupefied} condition is removed."

Enter the paper shredder, a clockwork device that performs exactly this function.",

				"Setting a piece of paper or parchment into the paper shredder takes a single Interact action, which means you can shred up to three pages of paper or parchment each round. If the page is longer than normal, it takes longer to shred, as determined by the GM. Additionally, only one person can use the shredder each round, limiting it to shredding three pages per round regardless of how many people are available to feed paper into it. The paper shredders rips and tears the paper or parchment apart into tiny disjointed strips. This is typically sufficient to destroy glyphs of warding and other similar dangerous magical traps on the paper, though the GM might determine that particularly resilient magical traps find some way to survive their shredding. If the paper is magically protected or otherwise has more Hardness than a normal sheet of paper or parchment, the shredder can't shred it. After churning such hardened paper for 1 round, the shredder spits it back out without harming the shredder. This prevents shredding any other paper during that round."
