				"A blue-green metal with an eerie green luminescence, abysium radiates power that's inimical to life. Careless exposure to the material can lead to long-term damage to the immune system; as such, mining abysium is hazardous, as large quantities of the metal in an area cause all nearby creatures to become sick. A creature carrying an abysium object is {@condition sickened|CRB|sickened 1} for a standard-grade object of light Bulk, {@condition sickened|CRB|sickened 2} for a standard-grade object of 1 Bulk or more or a high-grade object of light Bulk, or {@condition sickened|CRB|sickened 3} for a high-grade object of 1 Bulk or more. This and all other sickening effects of abysium are {@trait poison} effects. Crafters can use 1 abysium chunk to create up to 6 doses of poisonous abysium powder. Unscrupulous smiths have harnessed abysium's toxic properties to create noxious weapons and deadly substances. All objects crafted from abysium shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.",
