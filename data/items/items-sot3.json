The stone grows to its maximum size. While normally items with the structure trait put creatures in their area inside the structure, this effect creates solid stone, so it can't be placed in an area where there are creatures. While it's likely to take some time even with the right tools, an activated barricade stone can be destroyed the same as any normal stone structure (Hardness 14, HP 56)."
