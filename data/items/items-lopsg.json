The counteract modifier is +5 for the {@item replacement filter (level 1)|lopsg|level 1 filter}, +9 for the {@item replacement filter (level 5)|lopsg|level 5 filter}, and +17 for the {@item replacement filter (level 10)|lopsg|level 10 filter}. If you pour a liquid other than water, such as a potion or beverage, into the purifier, the filtration process negates the liquid's effects and ruins the taste. The center of the tube can be unscrewed from the ends to access and replace the chambers of purifying agents. Each filter can be used to cleanse up to 10 gallons of water at a rate of about 1 gallon every 20 minutes."
