This death is what caused the regent to recognize the true destructive power of the star guns and led to him developing the Star Code, a set of rules of engagement and proper use of firearms still in use in Arcadia today. Although Kaldemash never named the weapon himself, all legends that mention the weapon refer to it as Kaldemash's Lament.",

You roll twice and take the higher result on your initiative roll for the duel; this is a {@trait fortune} effect. In addition, you can draw Kaldemash's Lament as a free action at the start of your turn during the duel.
