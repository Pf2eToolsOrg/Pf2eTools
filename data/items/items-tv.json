Particularly notable stone armors or weapons might even be crafted entirely from a giant emerald, ruby, or sapphire, though they can still use the base statistics presented below. Stone can replace the striking surface of any melee weapon as long as it has no complex moving parts, and ammunition can be crafted with it. Stone can replace metal components in chain and composite armor; only plate armor that specifically describes itself as being made from stone can be crafted from this material.",

Such heckling tools are often born from implements useful to adventurers because such people are the likely to misuse tools or leave them in a corrupting situation. When you first set to using the tools, they fuse to you. Used for their intended purpose, the tools telepathically badger and disparage you, mocking your abilities and giving you ill-founded advice. You must succeed at a DC 19 Will save to realize this badgering comes from the tools and not your own negative thoughts. Instead of the tool's usual bonus, you take a \u20132 circumstance penalty to checks made using heckling tools. Once you realize the tools are cursed, you can suppress their {@trait negative} effects, gaining their typical bonus for 24 hours if you succeed at a DC 17 {@skill Deception} or {@skill Diplomacy} check to placate them, often by offering obsequious, public admiration."

You dictate whether the guard remains still in its area or patrols it; if the latter, you also determine the path the guard takes, at a Speed of 25 feet. You also determine a password others must give the guard to bypass it. If a creature enters the area without giving the password, the sentry creates either an audible or mental alarm. An audible alarm has the sound and volume of a human shouting, as well as the {@trait auditory} trait, allowing each creature that can hear it to attempt a DC 15 {@skill Perception} check to wake up if they're asleep. The mental alert reaches you if you're within 60 feet of the active guard (see below). The guard remains active for 8 hours, and then the fulu is consumed. If you have more than one sentry fulu, you can set up several that function as a unit, provided their areas touch or overlap.",

				"Resembling little more than a simple iron pipe with a handle, Kaldemash's Lament is one of the most well-known star guns in all of Arcadia. Legends state the Crowned Regent Kaldemash helped forge one of the first star guns millennia ago. While the star gun served Kaldemash as a powerful weapon, its most notable achievement was the accidental killing of one of Kaldemash's greatest friends. This death is what caused the regent to recognize the true destructive power of the star guns and led to him developing the Star Code, a set of rules of engagement and proper use of firearms still in use in Arcadia today. Although Kaldemash never named the weapon himself, all legends that mention the weapon refer to it as Kaldemash's Lament.",
				"The legendary weapon is a +3 major striking speed advanced firearm with a range increment of 90 feet. It deals {@damage 4d6} force damage (with the major striking rune included) and has the concealable, concussive, and fatal d10 traits. You don't take a penalty when dealing nonlethal damage with the weapon. Like most star guns, Kaldemash's Lament uses magic to function and doesn't require ammunition or black powder. If you use Kaldemash's Lament as part of a duel in which all parties are in agreement on the terms, the gun's supernatural instincts help you make the quickest draw. You roll twice and take the higher result on your initiative roll for the duel; this is a {@trait fortune} effect. In addition, you can draw Kaldemash's Lament as a free action at the start of your turn during the duel. If you attempt to fire the star gun in bad faith at a dueling opponent once they have surrendered, been defeated, or the duel is over, Kaldemash's Lament flies out of your hand and you can't pick it up, hold it, or wield it for 10 minutes.",
