This death is what caused the regent to recognize the true destructive power of the star guns and led to him developing the Star Code, a set of rules of engagement and proper use of firearms still in use in Arcadia today.

You roll twice and take the higher result on your initiative roll for the duel; this is a {@trait fortune} effect. In addition, you can draw Kaldemash's Lament as a free action at the start of your turn during the duel.

It always remains within 30 feet of you and intentionally resists being taken or otherwise moved; all attempts to Grab it fail. Kaldemash's Lament moves this way for 3 rounds, after which it returns to your hand. If you don't have a free hand to hold it, the gun instead holsters itself on your person.",

This attack increases your multiple attack penalty as normal, and the gun uses your multiple attack penalty when determining its attack bonus. Since the star gun is constantly moving and attempting to line up the appropriate shot, creatures it targets are {@condition flat-footed} to the gun's attacks."
