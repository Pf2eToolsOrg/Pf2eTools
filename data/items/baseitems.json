When these shaped plates are arranged and connected, they can be made to look like almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor, though armor embellishments such as those worn by highranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement process takes some time, but once it's completed, the user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards, when the user flips a switch on the harness's belt to one of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired preset configuration. The clockwork disguise can have up to three preset configurations at a time, and most users use a minimum of two: the one required for their current task, and a suitably inconspicuous configuration for when the first configuration is unnecessary.",
