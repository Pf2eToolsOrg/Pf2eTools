						"The horn is clearly audible for hundreds of feet, but within a 20-foot emanation, the sound causes agony in those who wish harm upon the user; the horn also sheds bright light in that area and dim light to the next 20 feet. Enemies of the user in this area take {@damage 7d6} sonic damage and {@damage 7d6} good damage (basic DC 30 Fortitude save). Creatures that are specifically vulnerable to sunlight are also {@condition frightened||frightened 1} if they fail this save or {@condition frightened||frightened 2} on a critical failure. This activation also attempts to counteract any {@trait darkness} or {@trait sleep} effects in the area ({@dice d20+23|+23} counteract check)."
