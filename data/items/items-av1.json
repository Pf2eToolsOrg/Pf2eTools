				"Gauntlight is much more than a 115-foot-tall lighthouse rising from the heart of an old ruin in Fogfen\u2014its pale stone walls extend far below the ruins, passing through eight different dungeon levels and finally terminating at the ninth level below the surface, where its deep foundation centers on an ominous chamber where, long ago, {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM} herself once physically brushed against this world. Once she finished its physical construction, the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source of power to infuse the walls, floors, and ceilings of each of Gauntlight's levels with eldritch power. The lens at the apex of the lighthouse would have, in time, been able to focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam, but Belcorra's plans were cut short before she could replace the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.",
				"As an artifact, Gauntlight can't be damaged by normal means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers of {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM}. They block effects that allow temporary passage, such as passwall, and also create a barrier against dimensional travel. The walls attempt to counteract {@trait teleportation} effects and planar travel into or out of areas within Gauntlight and efforts to summon creatures into the area (using a +37 counteract modifier); this effect does not stop a summoned creature from departing when the summoning ends.",
				"In Gauntlight's current state of diminished functionality, it can be activated only in the two ways below. By swapping in a series of magical lighthouse lenses that focus {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM}'s baleful gaze\u2014lenses so powerful that even Belcorra takes special care with them\u2014the artifact gains significantly greater power, including the ability to reach all the way to Absalom and to activate its effects every minute. These lenses are described in \"Eyes of Empty Death,\" the third adventure in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.",
				"To activate Gauntlight, a creature must be in the deepest portion of the artifact (this chamber is in the Temple level and is presented in \"Eyes of Empty Death\")",
				"From this point, a creature can observe the world outside remotely through Gauntlight's lens, including any area Gauntlight's beam can reach.",

				"This hefty tome was compiled centuries ago by an anonymous author who sought to collect all parables, myths, stories, and encounters with the Outer Goddess {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM}. According to the introduction, the author's original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved\u2014by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM} to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM}'s cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from The Whispering Reeds for too long are often cursed to rise as ghosts after death\u2014 though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM}.",

Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome's curse, Empty Death (see below)",
