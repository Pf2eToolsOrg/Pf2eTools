It resembles a leaf from some unknown tree similar to oak, carved from jade and then dipped halfway into black ink that looks wet despite feeling completely dry. The gate key was originally created to open the aiudara known as the Seventh Arch. In recent years, corrupting magic has given it additional, stranger powers.","When you wear and invest the Shadewither Key, shadows gather around you.

The shadows form an umbral double that resembles you in every way except for its fiery red eyes and the expression of wicked delight on its face. The double occupies the same space as you and attempts to intercept any attacks aimed at you. A creature must succeed at a DC {@flatDC 11} flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect; on a failure, they hit the shadowy double instead of you. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the double is hit, whichever comes first. Once the double is hit, it's destroyed. As long as the double exists, you don't gain the Shadewither Key's item bonus to {@skill Stealth} checks.","Destruction The Shadewither Key's magic can be destroyed by exposing the artifact to uncontained teleportation energies. If touched to an unlinked or malfunctioning aiudara, the Shadewither Key causes the gate to connect to a new counterpart. If this happens, the key's magic leaves it, rendering the item useless (as described on page 65)."]}]},{"name":"Bioluminescence Bomb","source":"GW1","page":0,"type":"Item","level":1,"traits":["uncommon","alchemical","bomb","consumable","light"],"price":{"amount":3,"coin":"gp"},"usage":"held in 1 hand","bulk":"L","activate":{"activity":{"number":1,"unit":"action"},"components":["{@action Strike}"]},"category":"Bomb","entries":["This vial of glowing goo constantly sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
