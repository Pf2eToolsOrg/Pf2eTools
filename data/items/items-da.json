				"This paper is crafted with an unusual formula, causing it to catch fire and self-immolate 5 minutes after being exposed to the air.",
				"The item activates automatically when the envelope is opened, which typically takes an {@action Interact} action. Anyone holding the note when it catches fire takes 1 fire damage. Often, these notes are given as practical jokes or threats, but secret societies find them quite useful when sharing information about upcoming meetings or any other relevant news. These letters must be written in haste and require the use of their accompanying envelopes, which prevent air from interacting with the paper until the envelope's seal is {@condition broken}."

				"Contrary to widespread belief, secret handshakes are not the preferred method of confirmation between secret society members, mostly because this would be obvious in the middle of a crowded street or busy tavern. Instead, societies tend to mark each other by carrying sibling's coins. The name was originally coined by a past secret society that has since fallen into obscurity, but its ingenious coins remain. The coins are innocuous, resembling common silver coins until the owner twists the outer edge clockwise. At this point, the face of the coin rotates to reveal the symbol of the secret society of the owner.",

				"While it's possible to notice the coin's mechanism if you specifically check the coin (DC 20 {@skill Perception}), few people individually inspect coins unless they have a reason to be suspicious of them."

				"This ring has a thick band supporting a square-cut gem that can be customized to the buyer's preference. The thickness of the band allows it to be taken to any jeweler or blacksmith to be adjusted to different hands or fingers from the original make. There is a tiny clasp at the side of the gem that, when pressed, opens the gem, revealing a small, hinged compartment. This compartment is designed to hold one dose of poison, allowing wearers to slip the contents of the ring into the food or drink of an intended target. The compartment can be closed again by gently pressing the gem back into place.",
