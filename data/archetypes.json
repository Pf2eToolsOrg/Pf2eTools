The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun.

Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner.

If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.",

At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.",

A {@class witch|apg}'s patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess.

These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype.

You don't have to literally be your own mechanic, as there's no requirement for a sterling dynamo to be particularly skilled at crafting, but even if you aren't, you can still \"feel\" what's right when it comes to adjusting and optimizing your dynamo. Whether you implement these improvements yourself or present your mechanic with ideas and insights that allow them to achieve something special on your behalf, your strength and ingenuity are what make you a sterling dynamo.",
				"As you train to use your dynamo in all sorts of adventures, you may become capable of feats its original inventors never dreamed possible. In fact, as you progress in the archetype and explore the possibilities, you might find that these inventors want to interview you in order to apply your insights and help them create a new generation of the technology with even greater capabilities. The sterling dynamo's adaptability grants it vast potential, so the sky's the limit!"

						"{@b Revulsion:} You can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a religious symbol of a non-evil deity. A creature must {@action Interact} to brandish garlic or a religious symbol for 1 round (similar to {@action Raise a Shield||Raising a Shield}). If you involuntarily come within 10 feet of an object of your revulsion, you gain the fleeing condition, running from the subject of your revulsion until you end an action beyond 10 feet of it. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of your revulsion, you can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, you overcome your revulsions for {@dice 1d6} rounds, or 1 hour on a critical success. ",
						"{@b Sunlight:} If exposed to direct sunlight, you immediately become {@condition slowed 1}. The {@condition slowed} value increases by 1 each time you end your turn in sunlight. If you lose all your actions in this way, you are destroyed. Due to your supernatural aversion to light, you don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors."

				"You are a zombie, a rotting corpse animated by necromantic magic. Although most zombies are mindless brutes, you're a husk zombie, preserved through necromantic rites and alchemical reagents. The process worked especially well on you, and you retained your intelligence and identity to a far greater degree than other husk zombies.",
				"It's not easy being a corpse. Your body continues to rot and putrefy, and the stench is ever present. Your old self keeps slipping away, more and more as the weeks pass by. Your reflexes have slowed, you're beginning to lose your sense of touch, and your emotions are dulling. As your body continues to decay, so too, does your mind. Your memory's not perfect, and although you haven't noticed any huge gaps or flaws yet, you have a feeling they're there somewhere.",
				"Unlike your other senses, your hunger has intensified. You ceaselessly crave the raw flesh and brains of the living\u2014the smarter the better\u2014and satisfying this hunger is the only thing that makes you feel alive. When you eat, you're reinvigorated; feeling returns and the constant mental torpor you live under vanishes. You feel like yourself again... for a time.",
				"One day you might be nothing more than a walking corpse, but for now, you retain your personality and your free will. Feeding your hunger might allow you to remain that way."
