This region is geared toward adventures that involve monster hunting, political intrigue, and the war with Xhorhas.",

For characters not from Western Wynandir, the players should consider what has drawn those characters to Hupperdook.

						"The characters are drawn into this adventure in the lower regions of the city of Hupperdook, an industrious gnomish enclave where long days of hard work in the forges and scrapyards end with evenings of extensive celebration and debauchery. A brilliant human engineer named Huron Stahlmast was assigned to Hupperdook by the Dwendalian Empire, where he led the development of weapons for the war against the Kryn Dynasty. After years of rising disapproval of his ideas and methods, Stahlmast was ousted by the folk of the city due to his eccentric experimentation and brutal means of testing his weapon designs. Shamed and without funds, the inventor allowed his dark hatred to push him to meet with agents of the Kryn Dynasty, seeking aid that would let him complete his work and enact his revenge.",
						"With the Kryn resources now funneled to him, Stahlmast has amassed and trained a force of kobold minions to help him steal resources from Hupperdook and establish a secret subterranean base deep within the Silberquel Ridge. As construction of his experimental weapons nears completion, Stahlmast plans to use those weapons against the empire that cast him aside.",
						"Stahlmast's plot to take over Hupperdook and hobble the military might of the Dwendalian Empire's gnomish war machine begins with a prison break. The target is a Kryn operative whose assistance Stahlmast needs. From there, the characters are drawn into the growing chaos orchestrated by Stahlmast and his minions, chasing down leads and eventually confronting the mad inventor within his mountain lair.",

The city's watchmaster, Bram Gulchswattle, hires the characters to investigate the breakout and to discover the whereabouts of Zabriss and her kobold allies.",

When the characters complete this encounter, they reach 2nd level and can return the subdued Sken Zabriss to Hupperdook and collect their reward.",

Once inside the halls of Stahlmast's mountain compound, the adventurers must uncover the depths of the mad inventor's betrayal of the empire.
