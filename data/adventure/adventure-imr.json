Many of these objects were subsequently lost over time\u2014and most resulted in the deaths of their owners along the way. But a few persisted, controlled by those able to glean some partial understanding of their operation.",

Legend of this object grew as it fell into the hands of a warlord and came to be known as a most powerful artifact: the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} (so named after its last owner). Yet with the defeat of Baron Lum, his {@i Infernal Machine} was said to have been destroyed as well.",

Bel is the deposed former master of that layer. But to rebuild the infernal machine, both devils require a number of missing components\u2014former control buttons vital to the machine's operation. Zariel and Bel have both planted agents in the world, tasking those agents with finding adventurers to track down and claim these components.
