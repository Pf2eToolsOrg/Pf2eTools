Lurking in the Sharkfeather Abyss, an ocean trench just west of the village, is a small clan of some dozen sahuagin that has grown weary of the shark hunters of Palma Flora. Year after year, the sea devils have attacked the shark hunters in an effort to spoil the tournaments, but their small numbers have seen them consistently defeated by the hunters and the village's hired mercenaries. However, things have recently changed.",
						"When a young sahuagin named Selachai lost her parents in a raid against the shark hunters during last year's tournament, her distraught prayers for vengeance touched the fathomless consciousness of Uk'otoa, an ancient leviathan trapped beneath the ocean. Selachai beseeched her new patron for the power to destroy the shark hunters and all who exploit the sea. She received that power in the form of a magic scepter tipped with a crystalline amber eye. Transformed by the scepter into a conduit for Uk'otoa's might, Selachai now leads the Sharkfeather clan on a path of dark retribution, and it's up to the adventurers to stop it."

The characters must fight to survive and have a chance to save as many villagers as they can before Palma Flora is overrun.",
						"In the end, the characters must leap aboard a ship fleeing the sinking village before they are overwhelmed. If they survive this attack and make it to the open water, they reach 2nd level. While aboard the ship, the characters interact with the crew and their mysterious tabaxi captain as they plan their next moves.",
						"In the last part of the adventure, characters who want to save Palma Flora and unravel the mystery of the sinking village are faced with several options. Captain {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} is keen for them to undertake the quest, and many of the nearby islands offer resources for underwater adventuring that might help them.",

The battle is vicious, as many of Palma Flora's shark hunters have been twisted by eldritch power into half-humanoid, half-shark abominations. No matter the outcome of the final battle, the adventurers are set up to continue their nautical adventures along the Menagerie Coast."
