				"A true shadowdancer is a creature who flits on the edge of light and darkness. Moving amid the inky blackness, shadowdancers are spies, assassins, infiltrators, and emissaries. Some shadowdancers use their relationship with the dark for good, while others embrace the primordial night, its terror, and its betrayal.",

						"The shadows call out to a potential shadowdancer in a myriad of ways. Often it starts with fear\u2014fear of the dark, fear of enemies, or an underlying uncontrolled anxiety and the desire to gain power over the darkness. Many potential shadowdancers hear the shadows whisper in their heads. First dismissed as some perverse trick of the mind, the whispers can seem to ebb and wane, but a true calling becomes more lucid and more compelling.",
						"In some shadow-infused lands in the Pathfinder setting, particularly Nidal, Ustalav, and even Cheliax, organizations search for and recruit those called by the shadows, eager to transform them into spies and assassins. But the call can come to any creature anywhere. It's just a question of whether the creature heeds the call and forms a pact with the shadows.",
						"Though it is hard to convince many folks otherwise, given the fearsome reputations of shadowdancers working for dark powers and cabals, there is nothing intrinsically evil about embracing the shadows. Darkness is amoral but not without its champions for good and even law, though it is true that such shadowdancers are few and far between."

While traps might grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair. Instead, when a battle takes place at a location of your choice, you have a major advantage thanks to your well-placed snares. Once your foes come to realize that you may have trapped any location on the battlefield, their fear of walking into another trap can help you corral them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place."

Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary."
