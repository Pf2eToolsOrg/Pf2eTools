Expanded alchemist's tools give a +1 item bonus to {@skill Crafting} checks to create alchemical items.

Sterling artisan's tools give you a +1 item bonus to the check. Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, blacksmith's tools differ from woodworker's tools.","{@b Backpack:} A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items. If you're carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its bulk is light instead of negligible.","{@b Basic Crafter's Book:} This book contains the {@quickref formulas|CRB|1|formulas|0} for {@skill Crafting} the common items in this chapter.","{@b Caltrops:} These four-pronged metal spikes can cause damage to a creature's feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 {@skill Acrobatics} check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage.

Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe.","Deployed caltrops can be salvaged and reused if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough caltrops are ruined that they can't be salvaged.","{@b Candle:} A lit candle sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.","{@b Chest:} A wooden chest can hold up to 8 Bulk of items.","{@b Climbing Kit:} This satchel includes 50 feet of rope, pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're Climbing, moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC {@flatDC 5} flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. You gain a +1 item bonus to {@skill Athletics} checks to Climb while using an extreme climbing kit. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit.","{@b Clothing:} Ordinary clothing is functional with basic tailoring, such as peasant garb, monk's robes, or work clothes.","Explorer's clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect you, even though it isn't a suit of armor. It comes in many forms, though the most common sorts look like clerical vestments, monk's garments, or wizard's robes, as members of all three classes are likely to avoid wearing armor. For more information on explorer's clothing, see pages 275 –276.","Fine clothing, suitable for a noble or royal, is made with expensive fabrics, precious metals, and intricate patterns.","You gain a +1 item bonus to checks to Make an Impression on nobility or other upper-class folk while wearing highfashion fine clothing.","Winter clothing allows you to negate the damage from severe environmental cold and reduce the damage from extreme cold to that of severe cold.","{@b Compass:} A compass helps you Sense Direction or navigate, provided you're in a location with uniform magnetic fields. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to these checks (similar to using a shoddy item).","A lensatic compass gives you a +1 item bonus to these checks.","{@b Crowbar:} When Forcing Open an object that doesn't have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the {@skill Athletics} check to Force Open (similar to using a shoddy item). A levered crowbar grants you a +1 item bonus to {@skill Athletics} checks to Force Open anything that can be pried open.","{@b Disguise Kit:} This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to Impersonate someone using the {@skill Deception} skill.","An elite disguise kit adds a +1 item bonus to relevant checks. If you've crafted a large number of disguises, you can replenish your cosmetics supply with replacement cosmetics suitable for the type of your disguise kit.","{@b Fishing Tackle:} This kit include a collapsible fishing pole, fishhooks, line, lures, and a fishing net. Professional fishing tackle grants a +1 item bonus to checks to fish.","{@b Flint and Steel:} Flint and steel are useful in creating a fire if you have the time to catch a spark, though using them is typically too time-consuming to be practical during an encounter. Even in ideal conditions, using flint and steel to light a flame requires using at least 3 actions, and often significantly longer.","{@b Formula Book:} A formula book holds the formulas necessary to make items other than the common equipment from this chapter; alchemists typically get one for free. Each formula book can hold the formulas for up to 100 different items. Formulas can also appear on parchment sheets, tablets, and almost any other medium; there's no need for you to copy them into a specific book as long as you can keep them on hand to reference them.","{@b Grappling Hook:} You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make an attack roll with the secret trait against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you're partway up.","{@b Healer's Tools:} This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for {@skill Medicine} checks to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds.","Expanded healer's tools provide a +1 item bonus to such checks. When you carry the tools from place to place, you keep many of the components handy on your person, in pockets or bandoliers.","{@b Holly and Mistletoe:} Plants of supernatural significance provide a primal focus for primal spellcasters, such as druids, when using certain abilities and casting some spells.","A bundle of holly and mistletoe must be held in one hand to use it. Other primal foci exist for druids focused on other aspects of nature.","{@b Lantern:} A lantern sheds bright light and requires 1 pint of oil to function for 6 hours.","A bull's-eye lantern emits its light in a 60-foot cone (and dim light in the next 60 feet).","A hooded lantern sheds light in a 30-foot radius (and dim light in the next 30 feet) and is equipped with shutters, which you can close to block the light.","Closing or opening the shutters takes an Interact action.","{@b Lock:} Picking a poor lock requires two successful DC 15 {@skill Thievery} checks, a simple lock requires three successful DC 20 {@skill Thievery} checks, an average lock requires four successes at DC 25, a good lock requires five successes at DC 30, and a superior lock six successes at DC 40.","{@b Magnifying Glass:} This quality handheld lens gives you a +1 item bonus to {@skill Perception} checks to notice minute details of documents, fabric, and the like.","{@b Manacles:} You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an exploration activity taking 10–30 seconds depending on the creature's size and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes a –15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC {@flatDC 5} flat check any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly the manacles constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from poor manacles requires two successful DC 17 {@skill Thievery} checks, simple manacles requires three successes at DC 22, average manacles require four successes at DC 27, good manacles require five successes at DC 32, and superior manacles require six successes at DC 42.","{@b Material Component Pouch:} This pouch contains material components for those spells that require them.","Though the components are used up over time, you can refill spent components during your daily preparations.","{@b Musical Instrument:} Handheld instruments include bagpipes, a small set of chimes, small drums, fiddles and viols, flutes and recorders, small harps, lutes, trumpets, and similarly sized instruments. The GM might rule that an especially large handheld instrument (like a tuba) has greater Bulk. Heavy instruments such as large drums, a full set of chimes, and keyboard instruments are less portable and generally need to be stationary while played.","A virtuoso instrument gives a +1 item bonus to {@skill Performance} checks using that instrument.","{@b Oil:} You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also set a pint of oil aflame and throw it. You must first spend an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with another action as a ranged attack. If you hit, it splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target. You must succeed at a DC {@flatDC 10} flat check for the oil to ignite successfully when it hits.","If the oil ignites, the target takes {@dice 1d6} fire damage.","{@b Piton:} These small spikes can be used as anchors to make climbing easier. To affix a piton, you must hold it in one hand and use a hammer to drive it in with your other hand. You can attach a rope to the hammered piton so that you don't fall all the way to the ground on a critical failure while Climbing.","{@b Religious Symbol:} This piece of wood or silver is emblazoned with an image representing a deity. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious symbol of their deity as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious symbol must be held in one hand to use it.","{@b Religious Text:} This manuscript contains scripture of a particular religion. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious text as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious text must be held in one hand to use it.","{@b Repair Kit:} A repair kit allows you to perform simple repairs while traveling.","It contains a portable anvil, tongs, woodworking tools, a whetstone, and oils for conditioning leather and wood. You can use a repair kit to Repair items using the {@skill Crafting} skill. A superb repair kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check.","{@b Sack:} A sack can hold up to 8 Bulk worth of items. A sack containing 2 Bulk or less can be worn on the body, usually tucked into a belt. You can carry a sack with one hand, but must use two hands to transfer items in and out.","{@b Saddlebags:} Saddlebags come in a pair. Each can hold up to 3 Bulk of items. The Bulk value given is for saddlebags worn by a mount. If you are carrying or stowing saddlebags, they count as 1 Bulk instead of light Bulk.","{@b Scholarly Journal:} Scholarly journals are uncommon.","Each scholarly journal is a folio on a very specific topic, such as vampires or the history of a single town or neighborhood of a city. If you spend 1 minute referencing an academic journal before attempting a skill check to {@action Recall Knowledge} about the subject, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. A compendium of journals costs five times as much as a single journal and requires both hands to use; each compendium contains several journals and grants its bonus on a broader topic, such as all undead or a whole city. The GM determines what scholarly journals are available in any location.","{@b Signal Whistle:} When sounded, a signal whistle can be heard clearly up to half a mile away across open terrain.","{@b Snare Kit:} This kit contains tools and materials for creating snares. A snare kit allows you to Craft snares using the {@skill Crafting} skill. A specialist snare kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check.","{@b Spellbook:} A spellbook holds the written knowledge necessary to learn and prepare various spells, a necessity for wizards (who typically get one for free) and a useful luxury for other spellcasters looking to learn additional spells. Each spellbook can hold up to 100 spells. The Price listed is for a blank spellbook.","{@b Spyglass:} A typical spyglass lets you see eight times farther than normal. A fine spyglass adds a +1 item bonus to {@skill Perception} checks to notice details at a distance.","{@b Survey Map:} Maps are uncommon.","Most maps you can find are simple and functional. A survey map details a single location in excellent detail. One of these maps gives you a +1 item bonus to {@skill Survival} checks and any skill checks to Recall Knowledge, provided the checks are related to the location detailed on the map.","Maps sometimes come in atlases, containing a number of maps of the same quality, often on similar topics. An atlas costs five times as much as a single map and requires both hands to use. The GM determines what maps are available in any location.","{@b Tack:} Tack includes all the gear required to outfit a riding animal, including a saddle, bit and bridle, and stirrups if necessary. Especially large or oddly shaped animals might require specialty saddles. These can be more expensive or hard to find, as determined by the GM. The Bulk value given is for tack worn by a creature.","If carried, the Bulk increases to 2.","{@b Ten-Foot Pole:} When wielding this long pole, you can use Seek to search a square up to 10 feet away. The pole is not sturdy enough to use as a weapon.","{@b Thieves' Tools:} You need thieves' tools to Pick Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the {@skill Thievery} skill.","Infiltrator thieves' tools add a +1 item bonus to checks to Pick Locks and Disable Devices. If your thieves' tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools; this doesn't require using the Repair action.","{@b Tool:} This entry is a catchall for basic hand tools that don't have a specific adventuring purpose. A hoe, shovel, or sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill, ice hook, or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be used as an improvised weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a short tool or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines the damage type that's appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.","{@b Torch:} A torch sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet). It can be used as an improvised weapon that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus 1 fire damage.","{@b Waterskin:} When it's full, a waterskin has 1 Bulk and contains roughly 1 day's worth of water for a Small or Medium creature.","{@b Writing Set:} Using a writing set, you can draft correspondence and scribe scrolls.

If you have different types of bonus that would apply to the same roll, you'll add them all. But if you have multiple bonuses of the same type, you can use only the highest bonus on a given roll—in other words, they don't \"stack.\" For instance, if you have both a proficiency bonus and an item bonus, you add both to your d20 result, but if you have two item bonuses that could apply to the same check, you add only the higher of the two.","{@b Circumstance bonuses} typically involve the situation you find yourself in when attempting a check. For instance, using Raise a Shield with a buckler grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. Being behind cover grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. If you are both behind cover and Raising a Shield, you gain only the +2 circumstance bonus for cover, since they're the same type and the bonus from cover is higher.","{@b Item bonuses} are granted by some item that you are wearing or using, either mundane or magical.

If you were under the effect of {@spell heroism} and someone cast the {@spell bless} spell, which also grants a +1 status bonus on attacks, your attack rolls would gain only a +1 status bonus, since both spells grant a +1 status bonus to those rolls, and you only take the highest status bonus.","Penalties work very much like bonuses. You can have {@b circumstance penalties {@b status penalties}, and sometimes even {@b item penalties.} Like bonuses of the same type, you take only the worst all of various penalties of a given type. However, you can apply both a bonus and a penalty of the same type on a single roll.

However, sometimes it's harder to move a certain distance due to {@quickref difficult terrain||3|terrain} or other factors.

Hence, a creature moving in a straight line spends 5 feet of its movement for every map square traveled.","Because moving diagonally covers more ground, you count that movement differently. The first square of diagonal movement you make in a turn counts as 5 feet, but the second counts as 10 feet, and your count thereafter alternates between the two. For example, as you move across 4 squares diagonally, you would count 5 feet, then 10, then 5, and then 10, for a total of 30 feet.

Your class determines your proficiency rank for various weapons. Sometimes, you'll have different proficiency ranks for different weapons. For instance, at 5th level, a fighter gains the weapon mastery class feature, which grants master proficiency with the simple and martial weapons of one weapon group, expert proficiency with advanced weapons of that group and other simple and martial weapons, and trained proficiency in all other advanced weapons.","The bonuses you might apply to attack rolls can come from a variety of sources. Circumstance bonuses can come from the aid of an ally or a beneficial situation. Status bonuses are typically granted by spells and other magical aids. The item bonus to attack rolls comes from magic weapons—notably, a weapon's potency rune (page 580).","Penalties to attack rolls come from situations and effects as well. Circumstance penalties come from risky tactics or detrimental circumstances, status penalties come from spells and magic working against you, and item penalties occur when you use a shoddy item (page 273). When making attack rolls, two main types of untyped penalties are likely to apply. The first is the multiple attack penalty, and the second is the range penalty.

A single adventure represents a complete story that might be connected to the larger arc of a campaign. Playing an adventure spans one or more game sessions—gatherings where the group plays a part of the adventure over the course of several hours.","A campaign provides the overall structure for your Pathfinder game. As you prepare for your campaign, you'll establish its scope and themes, which you'll then reinforce in the adventures and scenes that take place within it.",{"type":"pf2-brown-box","page":483,"name":"COLLABORATION DURING PLAY","entries":["As Game Master, you have the final say on how the world and rules function, and how nonplayer characters act. This rule's purpose is to make the game run smoothly, with one guiding hand ensuring consistency. It's not intended to make one player into a dictator over the rest of the group. Collaboration is vital to roleplaying games!","How you implement collaboration in a game depends on what your players are interested in. In some groups, players enjoy adding details to the world and to nonplayer characters. In others, players want to feel like the world is outside their control, and the only decisions they get to make are those made by their own characters. Both are fun and acceptable ways to play.","You are encouraged to collect input from your players before you start, asking what storytelling genres they'd like to emphasize, which areas of the world they want to play in, the types of enemies they'd like to face, or which published adventure they want to play. A good campaign includes some back-and-forth at the beginning as the players figure out what characters they want to play and you figure out what sort of adventure to run. The results can range from building an adventure entirely to fit the characters to choosing a specific published adventure, having the players make their characters, and then just adapting the beginning of that adventure so that all the player characters have a reason to be involved.","As you play, opportunities to collaborate will occur again and again. When players throw out suggestions or come up with specific theories about the events of the campaign, they're telling you what they'd like to see in the game. Try to find ways to incorporate their suggestions, but with enough of a twist that each still includes something unexpected."],"source":"CRB"},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":483,"name":"Campaign Length","entries":["The length of a campaign can range from a few sessions to many years. Two main factors determine campaign length: how much time you need to complete the story, and how much time players want to devote to the game.","A single session, or a \"one-shot,\" is great if your group is trying out Pathfinder or wants to play a specific short adventure. This requires a smaller time commitment but requires the GM to present the events of the game in a way that is immediately engaging, since there's less opportunity for the players to become invested in the story or setting.","If you want to play through a longer campaign, you'll need to add some story elements that speak directly to the characters in your game rather than just to the events of the adventure. In other words, the characters should have individual goals in addition to the group's overall goals.","You can estimate how long a campaign will take by looking at the amount of time you actually have to play, or the number of character levels you intend the characters to advance. It typically takes three to four sessions for a group to level up. Since you'll probably cancel sessions on occasion, playing once a week for a year results in roughly a 14-level campaign, playing every 2 weeks for a year gives you an 8-level campaign, and playing monthly allows for a 5-level campaign. If you play only once a month, you might consider holding longer sessions and using fast advancement (page 509).","It's entirely okay to have a campaign with an indefinite length. Many groups play through one adventure and then decide to take on another. If you run an indefinite campaign, however, avoid ongoing plots that you can't satisfactorily end if the campaign comes to a close after the next adventure. If you introduce an overwhelmingly powerful villain who's crucial to the story but can't be stopped until the player characters are 15th level, ending the campaign at 8th level will feel anticlimactic.","It pays to be conservative when estimating your campaign length and scope.

And still other campaigns end when players become unable to attend or decide its a good time to stop playing.","You should have an end point in mind when you start a campaign. Still, you have to be flexible, since you're telling the story alongside other players, and your initial expectations for the campaign may be proven incorrect. When you think you're heading toward a satisfying conclusion, it's useful to check in with the other players. You might say, \"I think we have about two sessions left. Does that work for everyone?

They include the major dramatic questions of your story and the repeated use of certain environments or creatures, and they can also include embracing a genre beyond traditional high fantasy. The themes you choose for your campaign also suggest storyline elements you might use.","A storyline's themes usually relate to the backstories, motivations, and flaws of the player characters and villains. For example, if you've chosen revenge as one of the themes of your game, you might introduce a villain whose quest for revenge tears his life apart and causes tragic harm to those around him. If one of the player characters is a chaotic good believer in liberty and freedom, you might engage that character by pitting the group against slavers. Or, you might choose a theme of love, leading to nonplayer characters involved in doomed romances, seeking to regain lovers they have lost, or courting the player characters.","Using similar locations and related creatures helps you form connections between disparate adventures. The players feel like their characters are becoming experts negotiating with giants, navigating seaways, battling devils, exploring the planes, or dealing with whatever the recurring elements are. For example, you might have the players explore a frozen tundra early on, then later travel to an icy plane filled with more difficult challenges that can be overcome using knowledge they've previously developed. Likewise, hobgoblin soldiers may be tough enemies for your group at low levels, but as the PCs attain higher levels and the hobgoblins become mere minions of another creature, the players feel a sense of progression.","Pathfinder is a fantasy adventure game, but you can shift your campaign to include elements of other fictional genres.

You can, however, ask for clarification if you need it, such as \"How far back should I rewind this?\" Some groups instead make an X with their hands, say \"Let's X that out,\" or use some other method.

However, avoid doing this if any of the players still have inventive and interesting things they want to try or spells they're concentrating on—ending an encounter early is a tool to avoid boredom, not to deny someone their fun. You can end a fight early in several ways: the foes can surrender, an adversary can die before its Hit Points actually run out, or you can simply say the battle's over and that the PCs easily dispatch their remaining foes. In this last case, you might ask, \"Is everyone okay if we call the fight?\" to make sure your players are on board.","One side might surrender when almost all its members are defeated or if spells or skills thoroughly demoralize them.

If not, the quarry escapes for now.","If the PCs decide to flee, it's usually best to let them do so. Pick a particular location and allow them to escape once they all reach it.

Look for repercussions. Which NPCs might view the PCs more favorably now? Which might hold a grudge or formulate a new plan? A social encounter can seal the fate of an NPC and end their story, but this isn't true for player characters.

These events should be tailored to each character and their goals, and they can serve as hooks for adventures or plot development.","Though the following examples of downtime events all involve Earning Income, you can use them to spark ideas for other activities. A character using Perform to Earn Income could produce a commanding performance of a new play for visiting nobility. Someone using {@skill Crafting} might get a lucrative commission to craft a special item. A character with Lore might have to research a difficult problem that needs a quick response.","PCs who want to do things that don't correspond to a specific downtime activity should still experience downtime events; you just choose the relevant skill and DC. For example, if a character intends to build their own library to house their books on magic, you might decide setting the foundation and organizing the library once construction is finished are major events. The first could be a {@skill Crafting} check, and the second an {@skill Arcana} or Library Lore check."],"source":"CRB"},{"type":"pf2-h4","page":501,"name":"Average Progress","entries":["For long periods of downtime, you might not want to roll for every week, or even every month. Instead, set the level for one task using the lowest level the character can reliably find in the place where they spend their downtime (see Difficulty Classes on page 503 for more on setting task levels). If the character fails this check, you might allow them to try again after a week (or a month, if you're dealing with years of downtime). Don't allow them to roll again if they succeeded but want to try for a critical success, unless they do something in the story of the game that you think makes it reasonable to allow a new roll.","The events you include during a long stretch of downtime should typically feature higher-level tasks than the baseline. For instance, a character Earning Income with Sailing Lore for 4 months might work at a port doing 1st-level tasks most of the time, but have 1 week of 3rd-level tasks to account for busy periods. You'll normally have the player roll once for the time they spent at 1st-level tasks and once for the week of 3rd-level tasks."],"source":"CRB"}],"source":"CRB"},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":502,"name":"Cost of Living","entries":["For short periods of downtime, characters are usually just passing through a settlement or spending a bit of time there.

Deduct these costs from a character's funds after they gain any money from their other downtime activities.","A character can live off the land instead, but each day they do, they typically use the Subsist activity (page 240) to the exclusion of any other downtime activity."],"source":"CRB"},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":502,"name":"Buying and Selling","entries":["After an adventure yields a windfall, the characters might have a number of items they want to sell. Likewise, when they're flush with currency, they might want to stock up on gear. It usually takes 1 day of downtime to sell off a few goods or shop around to buy a couple items. It can take longer to sell off a large number of goods, expensive items, or items that aren't in high demand.","This assumes the characters are at a settlement of decent size during their downtime. In some cases, they might spend time traveling for days to reach bigger cities.","As always, you have final say over what sort of shops and items are available.","An item can usually be purchased at its full Price and sold for half its Price.

They must spend this time resting in a comfortable and secure location, typically in bed.","If they spend significantly longer in bed rest—usually from a few days to a week of downtime—they recover from all damage and most nonpermanent conditions. Characters affected by diseases, long-lasting poisons, or similar afflictions might need to continue attempting saves during downtime.

It's reasonable for a character to retrain most choices, and you should allow them. Only choices that are truly intrinsic to the character, like a sorcerer's bloodline, should be off limits without extraordinary circumstances.","Try to make retraining into a story. Use NPCs the character already knows as teachers, have a character undertake intense research in a mysterious old library, or ground the retraining in the game's narrative by making it the consequence of something that happened to the character in a previous session.",{"type":"pf2-h4","page":502,"name":"Time","entries":["Retraining a feat or skill increase typically takes a week. Class features that require a choice can also be retrained but take longer: at least a month, and possibly more. Retraining might take even longer if it would be especially physically demanding or require travel, lengthy experimentation, or in-depth research, but usually you won't want to require more than a month for a feat or skill, or 4 months for a class feature.","A character might need to retrain several options at once. For instance, retraining a skill increase might mean they have skill feats they can no longer use, and so they'll need to retrain those as well. You can add all this retraining time together, then reduce the total a bit to represent the cohesive nature of the retraining."],"source":"CRB"},{"type":"pf2-h4","page":502,"name":"Instruction and Cost","entries":["The rules abstract the process of learning new things as you level up—you're learning on the job—but retraining suggests that the character works with a teacher or undergoes specific practice to retrain. If you want, you can entirely ignore this aspect of retraining, but it does give an opportunity to introduce (or reintroduce) NPCs and further the game's story. You can even have one player character mentor another, particularly when it comes to retraining skills.","Any costs to retraining should be pretty minor—about as much as a PC could gain by Earning Income over the same period of time. The costs are mostly there to make the training feel appropriate within the context of the story, not to consume significant amounts of the character's earnings. A teacher might volunteer to work without pay as a reward for something the character has already done, or simply ask for a favor in return."],"source":"CRB"},{"type":"pf2-h4","page":502,"name":"Disallowed Options","entries":["While some character options can't normally be retrained, you can invent ways for a character to retrain even these—special rituals, incredible quests, or the perfect tutor. For example, ability scores can't normally be retrained, as that can unbalance the game. But not all players necessarily want to exploit the system—maybe a player simply wants to swap an ability boost between two low stats.

The less frequently your group meets, the better notes and recaps you'll need to keep everyone on the same page.","Plan a time for everybody will arrive, and also try to set a time when playing the game will begin. This can make it easier for everyone to finish chatting, catching up, and eating in a timely fashion so you can start playing the game. Having an end time in mind is also fairly important. A typical game session lasts about 4 hours, though some groups hold 2-hour sessions or play marathon games. Less than 2 hours usually isn't enough time to get much done in most Pathfinder campaigns.

You're informed by the setting's backstory, your preparations, and the suggestions and assumptions the other players bring to the table. Keep in mind that until you announce something, your own plans are subject to change. For example, if you originally intended the owner of a tavern to be kindly and well-intentioned, but a player misreads her and invents an interesting conspiracy theory regarding her intentions that sounds fun, you might convert the tavern owner into an agent of evil after all.","You'll also determine when PCs and foes need to attempt checks, as well as the consequences of those rolls. This comes up most often outside of encounters, as encounters are more regimented about when checks happen and how they are resolved.

Too many interruptions break the flow. This is fine in moderation. Distractions become a problem if they're too frequent, as they cause people to miss things and make misinformed decisions as the session becomes disconnected. Yet every game includes breaks—sometimes intentional, sometimes not—and digressions. Finding the right balance of diversions for your group is essential.","A game is a social gathering, so there's definitely a place for conversation that's not directly related to playing the game. These interruptions become a problem if they're too frequent, or if people are talking over others. If a player repeatedly interrupts you or other people or undercuts every crucial moment of the game with a joke, talk to them about limiting their comments to appropriate times. Often, all you need to do is hold up your hand or otherwise indicate that the player is talking out of turn to delay them until after you or another speaker finishes talking.","Phones and other mobile devices are another major source of distraction. Banning them entirely is often impractical—many players use apps to roll dice or manage their character sheets, or they need to answer texts from their partner, check in on a work project, or otherwise stay connected with people who rely on them. However, you can set ground rules against using a device for anything that's not time-sensitive or game-related, such as refreshing social media, checking the score of a hockey game, playing a mobile game, or answering a non-urgent text. You can relax these rules for players when their characters are \"offstage.\" If a player's character isn't in a scene, that might be a good time for the player to use a mobile device."],"source":"CRB"}],"source":"CRB"},{"type":"pf2-brown-box","page":491,"name":"OFF-SESSION GAMING","entries":["Session play with a full group isn't the only way to play Pathfinder.

You can also give players opportunities to collaborate on details of the story, like having a player design a heraldic symbol for the adventuring group or map out their home base.
