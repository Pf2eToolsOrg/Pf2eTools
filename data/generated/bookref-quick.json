You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking persistent bleed damage from caltrops takes a –5-foot penalty to its Speed. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe.","Deployed caltrops can be salvaged and reused if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough caltrops are ruined that they can't be salvaged.","{@b Candle:} A lit candle sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.","{@b Chest:} A wooden chest can hold up to 8 Bulk of items.","{@b Climbing Kit:} This satchel includes 50 feet of rope, pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're Climbing, moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC 5 flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb while using an extreme climbing kit. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit.","{@b Clothing:} Ordinary clothing is functional with basic tailoring, such as peasant garb, monk's robes, or work clothes.","Explorer's clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect you, even though it isn't a suit of armor. It comes in many forms, though the most common sorts look like clerical vestments, monk's garments, or wizard's robes, as members of all three classes are likely to avoid wearing armor. For more information on explorer's clothing, see pages 275 –276.","Fine clothing, suitable for a noble or royal, is made with expensive fabrics, precious metals, and intricate patterns.","You gain a +1 item bonus to checks to Make an Impression on nobility or other upper-class folk while wearing highfashion fine clothing.","Winter clothing allows you to negate the damage from severe environmental cold and reduce the damage from extreme cold to that of severe cold.","{@b Compass:} A compass helps you Sense Direction or navigate, provided you're in a location with uniform magnetic fields. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to these checks (similar to using a shoddy item).","A lensatic compass gives you a +1 item bonus to these checks.","{@b Crowbar:} When Forcing Open an object that doesn't have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the Athletics check to Force Open (similar to using a shoddy item). A levered crowbar grants you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Force Open anything that can be pried open.","{@b Disguise Kit:} This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to Impersonate someone using the Deception skill.","An elite disguise kit adds a +1 item bonus to relevant checks. If you've crafted a large number of disguises, you can replenish your cosmetics supply with replacement cosmetics suitable for the type of your disguise kit.","{@b Fishing Tackle:} This kit include a collapsible fishing pole, fishhooks, line, lures, and a fishing net. Professional fishing tackle grants a +1 item bonus to checks to fish.","{@b Flint and Steel:} Flint and steel are useful in creating a fire if you have the time to catch a spark, though using them is typically too time-consuming to be practical during an encounter. Even in ideal conditions, using flint and steel to light a flame requires using at least 3 actions, and often significantly longer.","{@b Formula Book:} A formula book holds the formulas necessary to make items other than the common equipment from this chapter; alchemists typically get one for free. Each formula book can hold the formulas for up to 100 different items. Formulas can also appear on parchment sheets, tablets, and almost any other medium; there's no need for you to copy them into a specific book as long as you can keep them on hand to reference them.","{@b Grappling Hook:} You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make an attack roll with the secret trait against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you're partway up.","{@b Healer's Tools:} This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for Medicine checks to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds.","Expanded healer's tools provide a +1 item bonus to such checks. When you carry the tools from place to place, you keep many of the components handy on your person, in pockets or bandoliers.","{@b Holly and Mistletoe:} Plants of supernatural significance provide a primal focus for primal spellcasters, such as druids, when using certain abilities and casting some spells.","A bundle of holly and mistletoe must be held in one hand to use it. Other primal foci exist for druids focused on other aspects of nature.","{@b Lantern:} A lantern sheds bright light and requires 1 pint of oil to function for 6 hours.","A bull's-eye lantern emits its light in a 60‑foot cone (and dim light in the next 60 feet).","A hooded lantern sheds light in a 30‑foot radius (and dim light in the next 30 feet) and is equipped with shutters, which you can close to block the light.","Closing or opening the shutters takes an Interact action.","{@b Lock:} Picking a poor lock requires two successful DC 15 Thievery checks, a simple lock requires three successful DC 20 Thievery checks, an average lock requires four successes at DC 25, a good lock requires five successes at DC 30, and a superior lock six successes at DC 40.","{@b Magnifying Glass:} This quality handheld lens gives you a +1 item bonus to {@skill Perception} checks to notice minute details of documents, fabric, and the like.","{@b Manacles:} You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an exploration activity taking 10–30 seconds depending on the creature's size and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes a –15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly the manacles constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from poor manacles requires two successful DC 17 Thievery checks, simple manacles requires three successes at DC 22, average manacles require four successes at DC 27, good manacles require five successes at DC 32, and superior manacles require six successes at DC 42.","{@b Material Component Pouch:} This pouch contains material components for those spells that require them.","Though the components are used up over time, you can refill spent components during your daily preparations.","{@b Musical Instrument:} Handheld instruments include bagpipes, a small set of chimes, small drums, fiddles and viols, flutes and recorders, small harps, lutes, trumpets, and similarly sized instruments. The GM might rule that an especially large handheld instrument (like a tuba) has greater Bulk. Heavy instruments such as large drums, a full set of chimes, and keyboard instruments are less portable and generally need to be stationary while played.","A virtuoso instrument gives a +1 item bonus to Performance checks using that instrument.","{@b Oil:} You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also set a pint of oil aflame and throw it. You must first spend an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with another action as a ranged attack. If you hit, it splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target. You must succeed at a DC 10 flat check for the oil to ignite successfully when it hits.","If the oil ignites, the target takes {@dice 1d6} fire damage.","{@b Piton:} These small spikes can be used as anchors to make climbing easier. To affix a piton, you must hold it in one hand and use a hammer to drive it in with your other hand. You can attach a rope to the hammered piton so that you don't fall all the way to the ground on a critical failure while Climbing.","{@b Religious Symbol:} This piece of wood or silver is emblazoned with an image representing a deity. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious symbol of their deity as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious symbol must be held in one hand to use it.","{@b Religious Text:} This manuscript contains scripture of a particular religion. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious text as a divine focus to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious text must be held in one hand to use it.","{@b Repair Kit:} A repair kit allows you to perform simple repairs while traveling.","It contains a portable anvil, tongs, woodworking tools, a whetstone, and oils for conditioning leather and wood. You can use a repair kit to Repair items using the Crafting skill. A superb repair kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check.","{@b Sack:} A sack can hold up to 8 Bulk worth of items. A sack containing 2 Bulk or less can be worn on the body, usually tucked into a belt. You can carry a sack with one hand, but must use two hands to transfer items in and out.","{@b Saddlebags:} Saddlebags come in a pair. Each can hold up to 3 Bulk of items. The Bulk value given is for saddlebags worn by a mount. If you are carrying or stowing saddlebags, they count as 1 Bulk instead of light Bulk.","{@b Satchel:} A satchel can hold up to 2 Bulk worth of items. If you are carrying or stowing a satchel rather than wearing it over your shoulder, it counts as light Bulk instead of negligible.","{@b Scholarly Journal:} Scholarly journals are uncommon.","Each scholarly journal is a folio on a very specific topic, such as vampires or the history of a single town or neighborhood of a city. If you spend 1 minute referencing an academic journal before attempting a skill check to {@action Recall Knowledge} about the subject, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. A compendium of journals costs five times as much as a single journal and requires both hands to use; each compendium contains several journals and grants its bonus on a broader topic, such as all undead or a whole city. The GM determines what scholarly journals are available in any location.","{@b Scroll Case:} Scrolls, maps, and other rolled documents are stored in scroll cases for safe transport.","{@b Sheath:} A sheath or scabbard lets you easily carry a weapon on your person.","{@b Signal Whistle:} When sounded, a signal whistle can be heard clearly up to half a mile away across open terrain.","{@b Snare Kit:} This kit contains tools and materials for creating snares. A snare kit allows you to Craft snares using the Crafting skill. A specialist snare kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check.","{@b Spellbook:} A spellbook holds the written knowledge necessary to learn and prepare various spells, a necessity for wizards (who typically get one for free) and a useful luxury for other spellcasters looking to learn additional spells. Each spellbook can hold up to 100 spells. The Price listed is for a blank spellbook.","{@b Spyglass:} A typical spyglass lets you see eight times farther than normal.

Often, an effect can be both a trait and a damage type (this is especially true in the case of energy damage types). In these cases, the immunity applies to the entire effect, not just the damage. You can still be targeted by an ability with an effect you are immune to; you just don't apply the effect.

If you are immune to nonlethal attacks, you are immune to all damage from attacks with the nonlethal trait, no matter what other type the damage has.

A single adventure represents a complete story that might be connected to the larger arc of a campaign. Playing an adventure spans one or more game sessions—gatherings where the group plays a part of the adventure over the course of several hours.","A campaign provides the overall structure for your Pathfinder game. As you prepare for your campaign, you'll establish its scope and themes, which you'll then reinforce in the adventures and scenes that take place within it.",{"type":"pf2-brown-box","page":483,"name":"COLLABORATION DURING PLAY","entries":["As Game Master, you have the final say on how the world and rules function, and how nonplayer characters act. This rule's purpose is to make the game run smoothly, with one guiding hand ensuring consistency. It's not intended to make one player into a dictator over the rest of the group. Collaboration is vital to roleplaying games!","How you implement collaboration in a game depends on what your players are interested in. In some groups, players enjoy adding details to the world and to nonplayer characters. In others, players want to feel like the world is outside their control, and the only decisions they get to make are those made by their own characters. Both are fun and acceptable ways to play.","You are encouraged to collect input from your players before you start, asking what storytelling genres they'd like to emphasize, which areas of the world they want to play in, the types of enemies they'd like to face, or which published adventure they want to play. A good campaign includes some back-and-forth at the beginning as the players figure out what characters they want to play and you figure out what sort of adventure to run. The results can range from building an adventure entirely to fit the characters to choosing a specific published adventure, having the players make their characters, and then just adapting the beginning of that adventure so that all the player characters have a reason to be involved.","As you play, opportunities to collaborate will occur again and again. When players throw out suggestions or come up with specific theories about the events of the campaign, they're telling you what they'd like to see in the game. Try to find ways to incorporate their suggestions, but with enough of a twist that each still includes something unexpected."],"source":"CRB"},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":483,"name":"Campaign Length","entries":["The length of a campaign can range from a few sessions to many years. Two main factors determine campaign length: how much time you need to complete the story, and how much time players want to devote to the game.","A single session, or a \"one-shot,\" is great if your group is trying out Pathfinder or wants to play a specific short adventure. This requires a smaller time commitment but requires the GM to present the events of the game in a way that is immediately engaging, since there's less opportunity for the players to become invested in the story or setting.","If you want to play through a longer campaign, you'll need to add some story elements that speak directly to the characters in your game rather than just to the events of the adventure. In other words, the characters should have individual goals in addition to the group's overall goals.","You can estimate how long a campaign will take by looking at the amount of time you actually have to play, or the number of character levels you intend the characters to advance. It typically takes three to four sessions for a group to level up. Since you'll probably cancel sessions on occasion, playing once a week for a year results in roughly a 14-level campaign, playing every 2 weeks for a year gives you an 8-level campaign, and playing monthly allows for a 5-level campaign. If you play only once a month, you might consider holding longer sessions and using fast advancement (page 509).","It's entirely okay to have a campaign with an indefinite length. Many groups play through one adventure and then decide to take on another. If you run an indefinite campaign, however, avoid ongoing plots that you can't satisfactorily end if the campaign comes to a close after the next adventure. If you introduce an overwhelmingly powerful villain who's crucial to the story but can't be stopped until the player characters are 15th level, ending the campaign at 8th level will feel anticlimactic.","It pays to be conservative when estimating your campaign length and scope.

And still other campaigns end when players become unable to attend or decide its a good time to stop playing.","You should have an end point in mind when you start a campaign. Still, you have to be flexible, since you're telling the story alongside other players, and your initial expectations for the campaign may be proven incorrect. When you think you're heading toward a satisfying conclusion, it's useful to check in with the other players. You might say, \"I think we have about two sessions left. Does that work for everyone?

They include the major dramatic questions of your story and the repeated use of certain environments or creatures, and they can also include embracing a genre beyond traditional high fantasy. The themes you choose for your campaign also suggest storyline elements you might use.","A storyline's themes usually relate to the backstories, motivations, and flaws of the player characters and villains. For example, if you've chosen revenge as one of the themes of your game, you might introduce a villain whose quest for revenge tears his life apart and causes tragic harm to those around him. If one of the player characters is a chaotic good believer in liberty and freedom, you might engage that character by pitting the group against slavers. Or, you might choose a theme of love, leading to nonplayer characters involved in doomed romances, seeking to regain lovers they have lost, or courting the player characters.","Using similar locations and related creatures helps you form connections between disparate adventures. The players feel like their characters are becoming experts negotiating with giants, navigating seaways, battling devils, exploring the planes, or dealing with whatever the recurring elements are. For example, you might have the players explore a frozen tundra early on, then later travel to an icy plane filled with more difficult challenges that can be overcome using knowledge they've previously developed. Likewise, hobgoblin soldiers may be tough enemies for your group at low levels, but as the PCs attain higher levels and the hobgoblins become mere minions of another creature, the players feel a sense of progression.","Pathfinder is a fantasy adventure game, but you can shift your campaign to include elements of other fictional genres.

A line is a hard limit to the actions players might take, such as \"We're drawing a line at torture.\" The group agrees not to cross a line and omits that content from the game.","A veil indicates something that shouldn't be described in detail. The scene fades to black for a veil, or the group moves on to discuss a different topic, though whatever the veil is drawn across still happens. For example, you might say, \"We'll draw a veil across the scene as those characters head into the bedroom.\" You might come up with some lines and veils in advance, but then find more as play continues.","The X-Card Draw an \"X\" on a card, and you've got an X-Card. Place it on the table at the start of the session and describe its use to the players: any player can silently reject content they find upsetting by tapping the X-Card; whoever's speaking then rewinds a bit and continues on, excising the objectionable content. As with setting the basic guidelines for your campaign, there are no questions asked, no judgment, and no argument when someone invokes the X-Card. You can, however, ask for clarification if you need it, such as \"How far back should I rewind this?\" Some groups instead make an X with their hands, say \"Let's X that out,\" or use some other method.
