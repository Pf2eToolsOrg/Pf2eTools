While small gatherings of individuals happen all the time throughout Golarion, sometimes these groups reach numbers in the dozens, hundreds, or even thousands, becoming full-fledged organizations with internal structures that exert notable influences on the world around them. An organization provides several benefits to its members, its allies, and anyone else within its sphere of influence. These can range from simple camaraderie to physical resources to influence in the form of contacts and social and political clout. While the reason an individual may choose to join an organization can vary, most would-be members of an organization have something to gain by joining up with others for a similar cause.",

Each organization entry includes information on the organization itself as well as the organization's values and its role on Golarion. The entry also provides the rankings, titles, and structure used within the organization, including how a member moves up through its ranks. Following the organization's structure are a number of rules options available to members of the organization, ranging from access to new feats and magic items to new spells and archetypes. Most of these options are uncommon, making them unavailable to most PCs, but every organization entry details how its members can gain access to the listed options.",

The other alignments listed here work much like a deity's allowed alignments and include the other alignments common within the organization.

When you're playing with variant rules, be sure to let any new players who join the group know about the variant rules your group has chosen. This helps them set their expectations and ensures they don't feel ambushed by any variant rules the first time they're encountered in the game, which is important for making sure there is a feeling of fairness among your players."

Before the end of that creature's next turn, a trap poisons you, making you {@condition enfeebled} 2 for 1 minute.

						"To make their influence on Golarion felt directly\u2014but without manifesting on the planet in all their divine glory\u2014each god has the tool of divine intercession. Divine intercession manifests as a boon or a curse, of varying duration and power, visited upon a mortal. Curses are not triggered simply by doing something a god does not like, or everyone in Golarion would be cursed all the time; they are often reserved for followers of the god who commit anathema that aren't strong enough to warrant ejection from the faith, or those who have committed shocking blasphemies. Conversely, an unaffiliated worshipper embroiled in high-profile actions that are anathema to a god could earn a curse. Similarly, boons are not automatically granted to anyone petitioning the god. Certainly, someone who upholds a deity's edicts could earn a boon, especially when acting under adverse circumstances. Most often, as befits their inscrutable nature, a deity will bestow a boon or a curse for their own reasons. Perhaps a mission is of dire importance to a god's plan for a specific place or people, or perhaps the survival of a particular character figures in their plans decades from now.",
						"The divine intercessions provided in each entry are examples, and the GM can have any deity grant a different effect than the intercessions provided. These intercessions are special and are always at the deity's, and thus the GM's, direct discretion, with the GM deciding when a boon or curse goes into effect. The GM is also at liberty to remove a boon or curse as is appropriate for the game's story. A PC or NPC can never select a feat, spell, or other rules option that entitles them to a divine boon or bestows a divine curse upon foes. Minor intercessions are memorable for the recipient, providing either a relatively modest and long-lasting effect or a spectacular but fleeting one. Moderate intercessions are hugely significant events that typically come with permanent consequences, and major intercessions can pivotally reshape a recipient's life, granting powers wildly beyond their innate abilities or inflicting life-changing curses."
