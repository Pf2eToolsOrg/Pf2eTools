An organization provides several benefits to its members, its allies, and anyone else within its sphere of influence.

While the reason an individual may choose to join an organization can vary, most would-be members of an organization have something to gain by joining up with others for a similar cause.",

When you're playing with variant rules, be sure to let any new players who join the group know about the variant rules your group has chosen. This helps them set their expectations and ensures they don't feel ambushed by any variant rules the first time they're encountered in the game, which is important for making sure there is a feeling of fairness among your players."
