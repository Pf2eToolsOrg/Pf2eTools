For instance, in a gritty,  low-magic, survival-horror game,  you might start the PCs as 0-level  characters, remove alignment to  allow more shades of gray, alter  the proficiency bonus progression  to remove level, and remove  magic items\u2014all at the same time.  In general, the variant options  in this chapter are sufficiently  self-contained, with explanations  of how they change the game, that  you should be able to combine  them without trouble. When you  design your own variant rules, be  on the lookout for places where  new rules might have unexpected  overlapping effects on each other  and the game."

							"You might discover that your game requires variant rules beyond those listed here\u2014and that's okay! In fact, it's to be expected. Use these options as a starting point for some of the most commonly helpful tools, but you and your group should work together to build your own variant rules whenever you want a different experience. Don't be afraid to deviate from the baseline\u2014you and your group know what you like and what you're looking for better than a baseline rules set ever could. More about creating your own house rules can be found on page 29.",
							"If you're not sure about a variant rule, take a chance! Make sure everyone in your group understands that this is a trial run and that you might need to adjust or remove the variant rules later on if they're causing unexpected side effects or not working as you intended. When you're playing with variant rules, be sure to let any new players who join the group know about the variant rules your group has chosen. This helps them set their expectations and ensures they don't feel ambushed by any variant rules the first time they're encountered in the game, which is important for making sure there is a feeling of fairness among your players."

									"Immunities, Resistances, and Weaknesses Immunities, resistances, and weaknesses all apply to {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent damage}. If an effect deals initial damage in addition to {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent damage}, apply immunities, resistances, and weaknesses separately to the initial damage and to the {@condition Persistent Damage|CRB|persistent damage}.

If you have conflicting conditions that affect your number of actions, you choose which actions you lose. For instance, the action gained from {@i haste lets you only Stride or Strike, so if you need to} lose one action because you're also {@condition slowed}, you might {@i decide to lose the action from haste, letting you keep} your other actions that can be used more flexibly.",

									"For example, let's say you have been hit by a monster that drains your vitality; your wound causes you to be {@condition enfeebled} 2 and {@condition flat-footed} until the end of the monster's next turn. Before the end of that creature's next turn, a trap poisons you, making you {@condition enfeebled} 2 for 1 minute. In this case, the {@condition enfeebled} 2 that lasts for 1 minute replaces the {@condition enfeebled} 2 from the monster, so you would be {@condition enfeebled} 2 for the longer duration. You would remain {@condition flat-footed}, since nothing replaced that condition, and it still lasts only until the end of the monster's next turn.",
									"Any ability that removes a condition removes it entirely, no matter what its condition value is or how many times you've been affected by it. In the example above, a spell that removes the {@condition enfeebled} condition from you would remove it entirely\u2014the spell wouldn't need to remove it twice.",
									"Redundant Conditions with Values Conditions with different values are considered different conditions. If you're affected by a condition with a value multiple times, you apply only the highest value, although you might have to track both durations if one has a lower value but lasts longer. For example, if you had a {@condition slowed} 2 condition that lasts 1 round and a {@condition slowed} 1 condition that lasts for 6 rounds, you'd be {@condition slowed} 2 for the first round, and then you'd change to {@condition slowed} 1 for the remaining 5 rounds of the second effect's duration. If something reduces the condition value, it reduces it for all conditions of that name affecting you. For instance, in this example above, if something reduced your {@condition slowed} value by 1, it would reduce the first condition from the example to {@condition slowed} 1 and reduce the second to {@condition slowed} 0, removing it."

Selecting the Multilingual feat, for example, grants a character two new languages chosen from those listed in Table 2\u20131: Common Languages and Table 2\u20132: Uncommon Languages.
