If you target a solid unattended object or surface with your {@action Strike}, you might automatically destroy it without an attack roll. If you target any object or surface with Hardness 20 or less that isn't a magic item or the effect of a spell, you destroy it. If the target object or surface is a magic item or the effect of a spell, you attempt to counteract it using your attack bonus with the {@action Strike} for the counteract check. On a successful counteract check, you destroy the object or surface unless it has Hardness greater than 20, is an artifact, or is similarly difficult to destroy. You destroy up to a 5-foot cube of an object or surface larger than Medium."
