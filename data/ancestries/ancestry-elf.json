Elves who spend their lives among shorter-lived peoples often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die. These elves are called the Forlorn.",

An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who's lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elven fashion, like the elves themselves, tends to reflect their surroundings. Elves living in the forests and other wilderness locales wear clothing that plays off the terrain and flora of their homes, while those who live in cities tend to wear the latest fashions.",

At the height of their power, the elves clashed with the alien manipulators known as the alghollthus, and by extension the human empire that, wittingly or unwittingly, served the alghollthus' interests\u2014Azlant.

Elven societies that have been separated for thousands of years can still communicate with each other in the {@language Elven} language, with only minor difficulty. Within these broad ethnicities, however, is countless variation, fueled by the elven love of self-expression and freedom. Elves also develop a powerful connection to their surroundings, and elves who live in an area for long enough are known to slowly shift in appearance to take on aspects of their environment. As a result, elves of any ethnicity are prone to unusual features of all kinds, from white or lavender hair to bright gold eyes.",

Aiudeen are also known for making use of a network of smaller portals, known as aiudara, that connect to gates in distant parts of Golarion. To most Inner Sea residents, all elven culture is Aiudeen culture, filled with glamorous clothing, arcane prowess, and elegant twisting architecture. Yet though Aiudeen culture is highly sophisticated, it has historically been in decline since the elves returned, as Aiudeen struggle to reclaim what they once held and defend what they've managed to reclaim.

Beneath their masks, Spiresworn elves often have white hair and violet eyes; they have a wide range of skin tones, but their complexion is often ashen from a lack of light. Spiresworn rarely leave their island for any reason beyond patrolling Azlanti ruins, defending them from explorers seeking to claim ancient secrets.
