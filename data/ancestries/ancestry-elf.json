Elves who spend their lives among shorter-lived peoples often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die.

						"Elves are an ancient people, heirs to a civilization founded in the depths of humanity's prehistory. Migrants from the elven realm of Sovyrian first came to Golarion through a magical gate that stretched between worlds, powered by an enormous crystal known as the Sovyrian Stone. At the height of their power, the elves clashed with the alien manipulators known as the alghollthus, and by extension the human empire that, wittingly or unwittingly, served the alghollthus' interests\u2014Azlant. When Azlant's defiance resulted in the alghollthus summoning the disaster of Earthfall, most of the elves departed the planet, traveling back to their homeland to escape the destruction.",
						"Yet this was far from the end of the elves' involvement on Golarion. Not all elves left with their kin, some instead choosing to remain behind. Even the elves of Sovyrian still had their part to play in the planet's history. Sensing that something threatened the Sovyrian Stone and the magical portal that it powered, the elves began their return to Golarion in 2632 ar. They returned to find their former lands corrupted by the nascent demon lord Treerazer, who sought to corrupt the Sovyrian Stone into a portal to the Abyss. The resulting war between the elves and Treerazer left the demon confined to the Tanglebriar forest, defeated but still alive. With the battle against Treerazer fought to a hard-won standstill, the elves turned their attention to reclaiming their ancient holdings, and with it, their place upon Golarion.",
						"Though elves can appear similar to humans at a first glance, they are as otherworldly and mercurial as their distant homeland, appearing approachable in one instant and incomprehensible in the next. Elves are usually tall and slender. Their eyes range across a spectrum of colors, with irises that are far larger than those of other humanoids; this usually makes it seem like elves have little or even no white in their eyes. Elves' natural lifespan is measured in centuries rather than decades, often leaving them unable to relate to the mindsets of shorter-lived peoples. While their love of music and beauty is well known by others, elves' love of freedom runs just as deep, and many elves feel uncomfortable telling others how to live their lives\u2014to the point that most elven states hesitate to demand military service or collective action from their citizens. Many human nations have felt betrayed by the lack of organized elven aid during a crisis, despite the help of individual elves, due to this misunderstanding of the elven viewpoint.",
						"This love of freedom leads elves out into the world for a nigh-infinite number of reasons, making them a common sight among adventurers. Their long lifespans mean that even elves who have spent centuries in quiet contemplation might be drawn out from their homes due to exceptional events, or that an elf might find herself journeying to follow up on events that are fresh in her memory but long forgotten to others. Though elves often try to keep themselves distant from shorter-lived peoples, knowing that such friendships will inevitably bring grief, many wind up forging longlasting connections with traveling companions that can even carry down through generations."

Elven societies that have been separated for thousands of years can still communicate with each other in the Elven language, with only minor difficulty. Within these broad ethnicities, however, is countless variation, fueled by the elven love of selfexpression and freedom. Elves also develop a powerful connection to their surroundings, and elves who live in an area for long enough are known to slowly shift in appearance to take on aspects of their environment. As a result, elves of any ethnicity are prone to unusual features of all kinds, from white or lavender hair to bright gold eyes.",

A number of elves\u2014including the ancestors of the Mualijae, Ilverani, and Vourinoi elves\u2014did not depart Golarion during Earthfall, while the ancestors of the Aiudeen and Spiresworn elves left for the land of Sovyrian. Though the elves of Sovyrian returned centuries ago, they are in some ways considered newcomers by themselves and their kin, still tied to an ancient and distant homeland on another world.

Aiudeen are also known for making use of a network of smaller portals, known as aiudara, that connect to gates in distant parts of Golarion. To most Inner Sea residents, all elven culture is Aiudeen culture, filled with glamorous clothing, arcane prowess, and elegant twisting architecture. Yet though Aiudeen culture is highly sophisticated, it has historically been in decline since the elves returned, as Aiudeen struggle to reclaim what they once held and defend what they've managed to reclaim. With major changes on the horizon, many Aiudeen seek to look to the future instead of to the past, opening their ancestral homes to outsiders and reaching out to interact with their neighbors.",

Ilverani are starkly marked by their frost-white skin and hair, as well as their affinity for blue clothes and silver armor. They live among elven ruins in the frozen wastes, holding an extreme religious reverence for the places they call home. For the most part, they are as cold and unyielding as the ice that surrounds them, willing to do good for others but seemingly incapable of behaving warmly to non-elves. The one exception are the Twilight Speakers, Ilverani who believe that reaching out to and befriending other peoples is a religious duty to their patron goddess, Findeladlara.",
								"While many might wonder why a goddess of elven architecture\u2014and one known for her unwillingness to answer non-elves\u2014would encourage such behavior, this odd tradition stems from an aspect of elven history lost to most of Golarion. When Earthfall struck, many of the Mierani elves fled to Sovyrian, while others chose to escape underground. One group of elves, however, elected to stay on the surface for the express purpose of creating magical shelters to save as many other people as possible. The descendants of these elves eventually traveled north and became Ilverani. While they no longer need to build such elven shelters, helping others is still considered an honor to that legacy and thus to Findeladlara. That Ilverani as a whole are now so mistrusting of strangers may speak of some manner of great betrayal in the past, perhaps one connected to Findeladlara's refusal to accept the worship of non-elves.",

Whether these claims are true or not, Mualijae take their self-appointed stewardship very seriously, training themselves to stand ready to fight against anything that might threaten the world. Mualijae long ago split into three separate subgroups: Alijae, Ekujae, and Kallijae. Alijae are accustomed to the worst of the Mwangi's heat, with dark-brown skin and coily, dark-brown hair. Ekujae tend toward dark skin and eyes but are prone to individual variation from these norms, and are the Mualijae most likely to interact with outsiders. Kallijae have straighter hair than their kin and are seen only rarely outside their own lands. Mualijae elves have the dark skin and black hair of their human neighbors, and they usually possess jet-black eyes. Individual variations are common, however, such as rose-gold hair or glowing orange eyes. Fashion varies wildly between nations, but Mualijae tend to favor garb made from plants and wood, as well as natural materials such as bone, furs, and leathers.

The tower whispered to them in a dead god's voice, and within these divine whispers, the Spiresworn found a calling. Now considering themselves the true heirs of Azlant, the elves settled in the Mordant Spire and cut themselves off from the rest of the world. After generations of this isolation, the elves of the Mordant Spire have become secretive and xenophobic, bizarre even to their former brethren. Often refusing to speak anything but Azlanti, they wear elaborate wooden masks whenever dealing with outsiders, and they often change the subject or stop speaking mid-sentence, cocking their heads as if listening to an inaudible voice. Beneath their masks, Spiresworn elves often have white hair and violet eyes; they have a wide range of skin tones, but their complexion is often ashen from a lack of light. Spiresworn rarely leave their island for any reason beyond patrolling Azlanti ruins, defending them from explorers seeking to claim ancient secrets. As a result, Spiresworn are rarely seen as adventurers.

In addition, the Vourinoi consider themselves the sole stewards of their oases, and any attempt to control or corrupt the life-giving sites draws the elves' fury. Despite their love for their homes, Vourinoi also share a great sense of wanderlust, even by elven standards.
