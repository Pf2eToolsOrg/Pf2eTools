				"The reputation of hobgoblins in the Inner Sea region has been upended by Oprak, the hobgoblin nation established recently in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas. The Ironfang Legion that stormed through Molthune and Nirmathas only a few years ago made a calculated decision to cease fighting, claim Oprak as a new homeland, and seek peace with its neighbors. Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, the hobgoblins of Oprak have begun to cautiously investigate Avistan in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those that suffered terrible cruelties under the Ironfang Legion, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold soldiers might prove to be allies against the endless hordes of the Whispering Tyrant.",

						"Hobgoblin society's rigid militaristic hierarchy produces excellent adventurers, as hobgoblins reach adulthood trained for combat. Due to their upbringing, many hobgoblins have the {@background warrior} background. The {@background laborer}, {@background martial disciple}, {@background miner}, and {@background scout} backgrounds are also common. Hobgoblins raised away from their people often have the {@background criminal}, {@background hermit}, or {@background nomad} backgrounds instead. Hobgoblins are most often {@class fighter||fighters}, {@class ranger||rangers}, or {@class rogue||rogues}, although hobgoblin rogues approach their class with a disciplined mindset. Hobgoblins hold an ancestral grudge against elves and a distrust of arcane magic, which they call \"elf magic.\" Hobgoblin practitioners of arcane magic are exceedingly rare and usually shunned by other hobgoblins. Particularly clever hobgoblins usually become {@class alchemist||alchemists}."

Most hobgoblins fixate on social status, and many constantly strive to advance their social position. Hobgoblin punishments are primarily social demotions, although execution or slavery are common for serious crimes, such as arson or desertion.",

Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most hobgoblins don't trust it over the strength of their own sword arms. Their arts tend to have a military bent; many hobgoblins consider stirring marches and weaponsmithing the only artistic endeavors worth pursuing, though Oprak's enforced era of peace is beginning to change this."

Hobgoblins have no surnames, considering them both pointless and presumptuous; an individual's merits and demerits are to be earned by their actions, not by an association with a particular lineage."

Many hobgoblin adventurers aid or have aided in these tasks. Hobgoblins who make their home in the Onyx Vault usually have the warmarch or warrenbred heritages.

Of these, many become ruthless warlords, while others strive to prove that hobgoblins can be disciplined without being cruel. Hobgoblins from Kaoling often have the Warmarch or Elfbane heritages. Any of the ancestry feats presented here are appropriate, perhaps with modification; for example, a GM might swap out some of the weapons in the Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity ancestry feat to reflect weapons more commonly used in Tian Xia, such as replacing longswords with katanas."

				"text": "Brutally efficient in their outlook and society, hobgoblins brook no mercy for those they consider weak or useless.

Most peoples consider hobgoblins to be unrepentant monsters and assume they are hostile on sight, making them unlikely visitors to human nations. The exception to this perception is the Lake Encarthan region, where the hobgoblin nation of Oprak lies; though the hobgoblins of Oprak may be just as monstrous as their kin, Oprak's neighbors recognize that they are currently far less a threat than the undead legions of Tar-Baphon. As a result of signed treaties, hobgoblins are able to travel through Molthune, Nirmathas, and Nidal relatively unmolested so long as they don't break the laws of these nations.",
