						"Strix are avian-influenced humanoids with intimidating talons and feathered wings sprouting from their backs. With an average height of 6 feet, strix are taller than most humans but are very light for their size. Strix are considered mature at 14 years of age and have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have pointed ears and large eyes that are typically black from sclera to pupil, but occasionally appear as a piercing golden color. Strix lack the ability to move their eyes independently of their head, resulting in distinctive jerky movements as their gaze snaps between targets. Their bodies are usually taut with defined musculature\u2014a result of the strength necessary to flex their wings."

						"Strix are rare and reclusive people who cling to their ancestral territories. They live in modest-sized tribes, but some reside in smaller bands of tight-knit individuals. The largest settlements of strix reside on Devil's Perch, but a small number of their ilk have traveled far across Golarion. Strix feel an intense empathy and attachment to their family and other community members. They prioritize the needs of their community over their individual desires, and their bands and tribes benefit from an easy yet expertly organized division of labor. Strix tribes are led by a rokoa, a female tribal leader.",
						"A long history of conflict with the nearby nation of Cheliax has bred into most strix a deep fear and suspicion of humans\u2014who they call kotaara. Strix have struggled to keep hold of their territories and maintain their numbers in the face of constant conflict with these enemies who, in addition to trying to destroy what they believe to be winged devils, vastly outnumber them. Due to their strongly bonded groups, the loss of a single tribe member is devastating."

						"Due to their deep respect for the rules of a functioning society, strix are rarely chaotic, but some may be flexible on adopting the rules of outside societies. Strix are typically nonreligious and instead use stories from an epic known as the Korrsat Akra, or \"The Scattered Nest,\" to tell them of their origins and give them direction on their current place in the world. They have a deep investment in the lives of their fellows and experience intense grief at their passing.",
						"Pharasma is a common influence among religious strix due to the popularity of religious and spiritual practices honoring the lives and deaths in their beloved community. Gozreh is also an everyday influence for many strix, who beseech the Wind and the Waves to give them satisfying tailwinds for flight and protect their kin when the sky turns dark with fury. Erastil and even Torag represent two versions of social order and may be unifying deities across entire tribes."

						"Strix aren't native to the Inner Sea region. According to strix legend, they became permanent residents after being deposited among the steep spires and plunging valleys of Devil's Perch from somewhere distant and unknown by a catastrophic magical storm. Since their arrival at Devil's Perch, a mountainous area in the southwest region of Cheliax's Menador Mountains, strix have been in perpetual conflict with nearby human populations. Strix believe that this ongoing slaughter of their precious kinfolk is a continuation of a curse from the gods that banished them to Devil's Perch. The strix of the Inner Sea region have a dark relationship with their history, and mysteries lie obscured somewhere among the vast skies between their current residence in Cheliax and their distant relatives in Arcadia and beyond.",
						"Physiologically very similar to humans, strix most notably differ in the 12-foot feathered wingspans spread from their back and curved talons in the place of toes. Strix of the Inner Sea region universally grow white hair. Their skin tones and plumage most often range from black to gray, while some have brown to umber skin tones that complement the color of their feathers. Large, pointed ears and sharp brows give them very angular, defined features. Their eyes have no pupil and are fixed in their head, with nictitating membranes that blink sideways.",
						"Strix attire is simple. To allow flight, these avian relatives must keep clothing light and minimal and their feet bare to allow for adequate perching. Strix naturally shed their feathers, and much of this material makes its way back into their attire as ornaments; wearing the feathers of loved ones is particularly popular. A tribe's rokoa may wear a full cloak or headdress of her community's feathers, and the downy fluff shed by strix's young provides valuable insulation for winter clothing. At their core, most strix communities simply wish to be left alone to seek prosperity peacefully. Unfortunately, any acts of self-defense by strix are seen as further justification for violence by their enemies, who are already accustomed to treating strix as a scourge on the mountains and forests. The concept of vengeance is fluid but pervasive among strix groups. Strix generally believe that a certain amount of vengeance is just, but this conflicts with their general understanding of the value of life and kinship. Their itaraak champions, warriors of vengeance sworn to defend their people at all costs, protect their tribe fearlessly to avoid bloodying the wings of more sensitive souls. Rumors from fearmongering humans claim that itaraak champions habitually slaughter a hundred humans for every one of their kin that falls.",
