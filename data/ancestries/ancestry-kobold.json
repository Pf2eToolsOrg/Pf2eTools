Planar and primal kobolds sometimes hatch when a settlement is in great danger or exposed to planar energies, and are often considered to be destined for greatness.

Only once a trap idea has proven effective is it considered worthy to defend a kobold settlement.","{@indentFirst Trap-makers are treated by most kobold settlements as intellectual elites, and are often given the kind of deference other cultures reserve for priests and war heroes.

When they present a greater threat, it's often in conjunction with some other creature or group, such as a patron dragon or group of larger allies. These allies are usually credited with being the \"true\" threat, so small kobold groups have gained a modest level of acceptance among settlements that are otherwise unkind to outsiders. A band of 20 to 30 kobolds might be seen as a raiding party, and an assembly of hundreds would certainly be received as an army, but a single kobold, or group of four to six, is generally seen as an annoyance at worst, and more often a curiosity. After all, how much damage could just a few kobolds do?","Rather than take offense at this attitude, kobolds see it as a sign of other ancestries' foolishness. Immensely practical, kobolds happily take advantage of their reputation as cowards and weaklings. Many kobolds are perfectly happy to cringe and grovel to survive, never feeling any shame for doing so. This is due in large part to kobolds' self-confidence.
