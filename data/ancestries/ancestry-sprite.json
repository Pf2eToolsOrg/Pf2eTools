				"When most people picture a fey, chances are they're thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in the First World, where they are essentially immortal, reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life eventually comes to an end. Some even meld together with others to form a more substantial body or split apart into multiple smaller fey. However, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic, leading a significant number to risk the mortal world to explore the new possibilities offered by the unusually static nature of mortal existence. These creatures mix in with other, smaller groups of Material Plane comrades, including exiles from the First World, those whose family swore pacts to mortals, and even contemplative individuals curious to enter the mortal cycle of souls.",
				"The first generation of Material Plane sprites were content to guard magical locations or objects, learn music, and play pranks on the unsuspecting. Panic struck when children born in the mortal world didn't form wings upon adulthood\u2014some sprites transitioning to the mortal world likewise lost their wings after a time. Believing this to be a sign that the mortal world was too alien for them to live there, many of the initial sprite explorers returned to the safety of the First World.",
				"However, their wingless children exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes, but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As they came close to reaching their full strength, many of them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique, and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen before, a sign of their limitless potential.",

Those sprites with humbler destinies typically grow wings when reaching full adulthood and mastering their innate magic.

						"PCs are typically Small or Medium size, but most sprite PCs are Tiny instead! Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space and reach. Your Tiny sprite can enter another creature's space, which is important because your melee {@action Strike||Strikes} typically have no reach, meaning you must enter their space to attack them. Like other Tiny creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to {@action Take Cover}. You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a reach <5 feet> shorter than normal if they have the reach trait). Remember to adjust the {@table Bulk Conversions||Bulk of items and your Bulk limit for Tiny size}."

However, the amount of coordination required to ensure you don't get in each other's way or jostle each other into losing actions makes this tactic unfavorable for most fellow adventurers during combat. If you're riding along with another PC or similar non-minion intelligent creature, roll both your initiatives and use the lower of the two results. You act in either order on the same initiative count. While traveling in this way, you each gain two actions at the start of your turn, instead of three, since they spend one action keeping you balanced on their back, and you spend one action maintaining your grip."

						"Unlike almost any other ancestry, sprites have distinctive heritages that almost always correlate to their societies, and they don't have any consistent ethnicities beyond that. This oddity has led many scholars to classify the various heritages of sprites as different creatures altogether, a fact that endlessly amuses the fey, who don't bother correcting such hilarious mistakes. In truth, these fairies are capable of forming families and kin groups across their various heritages, and the fact of reincarnation in the First World means that they don't see ancestry in quite the same way as mortal creatures. A sprite's parent might die and return as a young dryad, and there wouldn't be anything remotely unusual about that. So too do these tiny fey quickly accept people of every sort who make a genuine effort to know them, even those creatures that mortals tend to find dangerous or distasteful.",
