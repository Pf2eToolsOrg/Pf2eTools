They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic."],"info":["When most people picture a fey, chances are they're thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in the First World, where they are essentially immortal, reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life eventually comes to an end. Some even meld together with others to form a more substantial body or split apart into multiple smaller fey. However, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic, leading a significant number to risk the mortal world to explore the new possibilities offered by the unusually static nature of mortal existence. These creatures mix in with other, smaller groups of Material Plane comrades, including exiles from the First World, those whose family swore pacts to mortals, and even contemplative individuals curious to enter the mortal cycle of souls.","The first generation of Material Plane sprites were content to guard magical locations or objects, learn music, and play pranks on the unsuspecting. Panic struck when children born in the mortal world didn't form wings upon adulthood—some sprites transitioning to the mortal world likewise lost their wings after a time. Believing this to be a sign that the mortal world was too alien for them to live there, many of the initial sprite explorers returned to the safety of the First World.","However, their wingless children exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes, but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As they came close to reaching their full strength, many of them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique, and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen before, a sign of their limitless potential.","If you want a character who is tiny, mercurial, and curious, you should play a sprite.",{"type":"pf2-h3","page":126,"name":"You Might...","entries":[{"type":"list","items":["Play good-natured pranks on those around you, intended to teach a lesson, aid in locating a lost item, or even help find love.","Become sidetracked by something new and eye-catching before you have fully followed through on your previous plan.","Find something magical that's so important to you, you can't help but protect it with every ounce of your strength."]}]},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":126,"name":"Others Probably...","entries":[{"type":"list","items":["Expect you to know strange fey mysteries and perform fantastical primal magic well beyond your actual abilities.","Consider you the prime suspect whenever unexplained hijinks or serendipity comes their way.","Misconstrue the way your mind works, seeing your flitting attention as a sign of being scatterbrained."]}]},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":126,"name":"Physical Description","entries":["Sprites are tiny faeries whose features vary wildly based on their heritage. The Wingless—those with the potential to become powerful heroes and villains, including all PC sprites—slowly grow their wings over time as their magical potential manifests, though some never grow wings at all.

Sprites reach adulthood at around the same rate as humans do, but a typical fey who can manage to stay out of mischief and danger can live 1,000 years or more.

Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space and reach. Your Tiny sprite can enter another creature's space, which is important because your melee {@action Strike||Strikes} typically have no reach, meaning you must enter their space to attack them. Like other Tiny creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to {@action Take Cover}. You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a reach <5 feet> shorter than normal if they have the reach trait).

If you're riding along with another PC or similar non-minion intelligent creature, roll both your initiatives and use the lower of the two results. You act in either order on the same initiative count.

In truth, these fairies are capable of forming families and kin groups across their various heritages, and the fact of reincarnation in the First World means that they don't see ancestry in quite the same way as mortal creatures.
