				"When most people picture a fey, chances are they're thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in the First World, where they are essentially immortal, reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life eventually comes to an end. Some even meld together with others to form a more substantial body or split apart into multiple smaller fey. However, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic, leading a significant number to risk the mortal world to explore the new possibilities offered by the unusually static nature of mortal existence. These creatures mix in with other, smaller groups of Material Plane comrades, including exiles from the First World, those whose family swore pacts to mortals, and even contemplative individuals curious to enter the mortal cycle of souls.",
				"The first generation of Material Plane sprites were content to guard magical locations or objects, learn music, and play pranks on the unsuspecting. Panic struck when children born in the mortal world didn't form wings upon adulthood\u2014some sprites transitioning to the mortal world likewise lost their wings after a time. Believing this to be a sign that the mortal world was too alien for them to live there, many of the initial sprite explorers returned to the safety of the First World.",
				"However, their wingless children exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes, but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As they came close to reaching their full strength, many of them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique, and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen before, a sign of their limitless potential.",

Those sprites with humbler destinies typically grow wings when reaching full adulthood and mastering their innate magic. Sprites reach adulthood at around the same rate as humans do, but a typical fey who can manage to stay out of mischief and danger can live 1,000 years or more. Material Plane sprites who sense their time is coming to an end usually return to the First World to be reborn and start their adventure all over again."

						"Unlike almost any other ancestry, sprites have distinctive heritages that almost always correlate to their societies, and they don't have any consistent ethnicities beyond that. This oddity has led many scholars to classify the various heritages of sprites as different creatures altogether, a fact that endlessly amuses the fey, who don't bother correcting such hilarious mistakes. In truth, these fairies are capable of forming families and kin groups across their various heritages, and the fact of reincarnation in the First World means that they don't see ancestry in quite the same way as mortal creatures. A sprite's parent might die and return as a young dryad, and there wouldn't be anything remotely unusual about that. So too do these tiny fey quickly accept people of every sort who make a genuine effort to know them, even those creatures that mortals tend to find dangerous or distasteful.",
						"Sprites on Golarion who live among their own kind typically form villages near exciting locations. That doesn't mean other sorts of sprites are unwelcome but is rather a reflection of the composition of the group that set off to form the village in the first place.

The first draxies were reincarnations of Elucredassa, the mightiest faerie dragon of known draxie history, who returned as hundreds of individual draxies when she passed on. Since then, draxies have become more populous and spread to all corners of the First World, as well as areas of Golarion where dragons and fey are common, such as the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Draxies have the same capricious yet benevolent tendencies as their faerie dragon forebear, but they have one exception to their flighty nature: they bond with their closest comrades for life. Called the elucrea, this special bond can form with creatures a draxie is particularly fond of from any ancestry\u2014though typically only those who can take a good joke. Fey folklore holds that the longing for the elucrea comes from when draxies were first split from Elucredassa, as each longs to become part of something bigger than themselves."

These diminutive explorers are more obsessed with magic than most, and they love studying ley lines and magical locations. Their curiosity, wanderlust, and chaotic nature balance their compulsive urge to protect that which they find most wonderful. Whether it be an object, a creature, or a location, once a sprite decides to appoint itself guardian, they pursue this task with remarkable dedication. It takes a tremendous magical mystery or discovery to shake a sprite's vigil."

								"PCs are typically Small or Medium size, but most sprite PCs are Tiny instead! Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space and reach. Your Tiny sprite can enter another creature's space, which is important because your melee Strikes typically have no reach, meaning you must enter their space to attack them. Like other Tiny creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to Take Cover. You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a reach 5 feet shorter than normal if they have the reach trait). Remember to adjust the Bulk of items and your Bulk limit for Tiny size (Core Rulebook 295)."

								"Grigs are artistic, musical, and passionate sprites with the hind body of a cricket. They often use their legs as stringed instruments, fiddling along with their songs in the same way most folk might clap their hands or snap their fingers. Cunning and courageous, grigs are always ready to protect those they love, and even strangers, from the forces of evil, but they tend to get themselves into trouble by biting off more than they can chew. Thus, adventuring with comrades suits a grig well, as friends can help them overcome otherwise unbeatable odds. Grigs love to collect art objects of all kinds, particularly those with bright colors and vibrant images, decorating their homes with wondrous mementos of their journeys and adventures. Grigs usually make their homes and villages in areas of incredible natural beauty, though they are just as often out exploring and seeking new wonders away from home."

								"While most sprites have insectile wings, melixies are closer to insects than other sprites, sharing additional physical qualities\u2014usually with bees, but sometimes with butterflies, moths, ladybugs, or other beetles. Melixies have an incredibly strong sweet tooth, guzzling honey, nectar, and sugar at every opportunity. These tiny sugar collectors occasionally leave such delicacies uneaten long enough to use them as ingredients to create some of the world's finest miniature desserts. When not indulging, they're incredibly industrious, both at innovative tasks other sprites enjoy, like inventing and building new things, and at repetitive tasks most others find odious, such as cleaning. Melixies enjoy dancing over all other leisure activities and are particularly likely to learn a dancelike Sylvan sign language they call Melisylvan."

Nyktera appearance varies as much as the various species of bats. Some look like insectivorous microbats, while others resemble larger, fruit-eating megabats such as flying foxes. Even more may resemble nectar-eating bats, and even blood-drinking varieties. Nykteras live wherever bats are found, and they tend to congregate near areas with bats similar to their own appearance. Notably, a population of white nykteras from Arcadia, who share features with an Arcadian white bat species, has given birth to the highest number of Wingless anywhere in Golarion. This has lead some to speculate they've been blessed by the gods. Nykteras have an incredible sense of hospitality and are willing to share food with any in need; even a nyktera's greatest enemy might be able to find a reprieve from battle by invoking the bat sprite's hospitality."

Pixies love pranks, and they often compete with draxies over who make the better pranksters. While they lack draxies' patience to perfect a trap over the long term, pixies are improvisational prank maestros. Pixie pranks are typically intended to reveal an overlooked truth, whether by bringing the prideful down to size or matchmaking two people secretly in love with each other. Larger than any other type of sprite, Wingless pixies can sometimes pass for halflings if they disguise their pointed ears. Their closer size to other ancestries means they are somewhat more likely to be taken seriously by mortals."

								"As a Tiny creature, a sprite PC weighs so little and takes up so little Bulk that it doesn't cause issues to hitch a ride in a sack, shoulder, or other position on another PC. However, the amount of coordination required to ensure you don't get in each other's way or jostle each other into losing actions makes this tactic unfavorable for most fellow adventurers during combat. If you're riding along with another PC or similar non-minion intelligent creature, roll both your initiatives and use the lower of the two results. You act in either order on the same initiative count. While traveling in this way, you each gain two actions at the start of your turn, instead of three, since they spend one action keeping you balanced on their back, and you spend one action maintaining your grip."
