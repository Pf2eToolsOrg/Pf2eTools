As quick as these reflexes are, catfolk have quicker tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry.",

To those of the Expanse, the sight of bipedal pantherlike people moving through the thick foliage is one of the gravest omens of death that can be observed.
