As quick as these reflexes are, catfolk have quicker tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry.",

Catfolk learn a trade in a loose apprenticeship, and the majority learn several trades over their lives.",
