				"Magic and science that can warp bone and twist sinew are all too common on Golarion. Fleshwarps are those who have been permanently altered by such methods\u2014sometimes a sapient being created whole cloth from inanimate flesh, but often a victim unwillingly transformed by strange energies or sadistic creators.",
				"The ancestry name \"fleshwarp\" is an umbrella term, since on Golarion the actual fleshwarping process is more infamously well-known than are alterations caused by uncontrolled magic, technology, or fringe science. Whether practiced by Thassilonian wizards, Nexian fleshcrafters, or the drow of the Darklands, fleshwarping is the craft of reshaping flesh and mind in vats of foul magical reagents. This has led some scholars of monsters to argue that only those beings created by traditional fleshwarping should be considered fleshwarps. Regardless of the source of their altered forms, fleshwarps bear their new shape forever, transformed beings living a wild and strange existence beyond what was possible for their original ancestry.",
				"Although fleshwarps are humanoid, no two look the same. One might possess limbs in unusual places and skin as smooth as glass, while another might have a thick matting of spiny fur. Some might have animalistic features, like a boar snout, scales, or cloven hooves. Others have entirely alien appearances, such as bulging eyes on the backs of their hands. Some may have only subtly uncanny features that differentiate them, such as glowing teeth, smoking eyes, or fingernails made of bone. The only commonality among fleshwarps is their mismatched nature. Let your imagination run wild when creating a fleshwarp character!",
				"If you want a character who is tough and hardy, can change their form as they grow, and can use their wholly unique appearance to inspire awe or fear in others, you should play a fleshwarp.",

Fleshwarps differ widely in their appearance due to the unique circumstances of their creation.

						"Fleshwarps have little to gain from the broader society, and therefore rarely work to support society in turn, beyond perhaps helping other fleshwarps. They need to be able to adapt quickly to survive on their own. As a consequence, few fleshwarps are lawful. Although bigoted or short-sighted people view fleshwarps as monsters, fleshwarps are no more or less prone to evil than any other people, and most seek only to live their lives without trouble. Most are neutral in alignment, for while alienation doesn't force a fleshwarp to feel contempt for others, neither does it encourage a fleshwarp to avoid it. This is especially true for fleshwarps living in the societies that gave birth to their traumatic transformation. Fleshwarps aren't often casually religious; most either have little to do with faith at all (viewing themselves as scorned by the gods or simply seeing faith as impractical for survival) or are exceptionally devout. Religious fleshwarps often revere Arazni, Calistria, Desna, or Gozreh; evil fleshwarps typically turn to Lamashtu, finding consolation in the Mother of Monsters."

The former sometimes hide their new forms, seeking shelter among their prior society with those open-minded enough to shield them from the less understanding\u2014though unfortunately, there are no guarantees that their friends and family members will be protectors, rather than persecutors. These fleshwarps know best how to blend into their erstwhile societies and might go undiscovered for a long period of time. Fleshwarps born into their warped forms generally have a more difficult upbringing and were likely often forced to fend for themselves, particularly if rejected by parents who considered their form blasphemous or ill-fated. They're likely to accept their own bodies, as they've never known another.",

						"Beyond their transformations, little binds these people into a shared identity: some, especially those who experience their corporeal changes later in life, reject identifying as fleshwarps and cling to the ancestries of their birth, while others, often those who were born into these states of transfiguration, are more accepting of the fleshwarp identity. Adding to these disparate origins, scant uniformity exists for fleshwarps' physical features, except for those literally built to certain designs. One fleshwarp might have limbs swathed in brilliantly plumed patagia to glide on the surge winds. Another fleshwarp might look like the rest of their battle batch, their prodigious frame crisscrossed symmetrically with thousands of tiny hook quills to facilitate rigging armored plates."
