Their unorthodox appearance can make it difficult for them to find a place for themselves in the world."],"info":["Magic and science that can warp bone and twist sinew are all too common on Golarion. Fleshwarps are those who have been permanently altered by such methods—sometimes a sapient being created whole cloth from inanimate flesh, but often a victim unwillingly transformed by strange energies or sadistic creators.","The ancestry name \"fleshwarp\" is an umbrella term, since on Golarion the actual fleshwarping process is more infamously well-known than are alterations caused by uncontrolled magic, technology, or fringe science. Whether practiced by Thassilonian wizards, Nexian fleshcrafters, or the drow of the Darklands, fleshwarping is the craft of reshaping flesh and mind in vats of foul magical reagents. This has led some scholars of monsters to argue that only those beings created by traditional fleshwarping should be considered fleshwarps. Regardless of the source of their altered forms, fleshwarps bear their new shape forever, transformed beings living a wild and strange existence beyond what was possible for their original ancestry.","Although fleshwarps are humanoid, no two look the same. One might possess limbs in unusual places and skin as smooth as glass, while another might have a thick matting of spiny fur. Some might have animalistic features, like a boar snout, scales, or cloven hooves. Others have entirely alien appearances, such as bulging eyes on the backs of their hands. Some may have only subtly uncanny features that differentiate them, such as glowing teeth, smoking eyes, or fingernails made of bone. The only commonality among fleshwarps is their mismatched nature. Let your imagination run wild when creating a fleshwarp character!","If you want a character who is tough and hardy, can change their form as they grow, and can use their wholly unique appearance to inspire awe or fear in others, you should play a fleshwarp.",{"type":"pf2-h3","page":88,"name":"You Might...","entries":[{"type":"list","items":["Embrace your unusual appearance to inspire respect or fear.","Be used to relying on yourself.","Distrust large groups of people, particularly mobs, based on past experiences."]}]},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":88,"name":"Others Probably...","entries":[{"type":"list","items":["Find your physiology fascinating or terrifying.","Assume you are an expert on strange creatures or occult phenomena.","Consider you an enigmatic and unpredictable—and perhaps even dangerous—outsider."]}]},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":89,"name":"Physical Description","entries":["Fleshwarps are humanoids, ranging from 5 to 7 feet tall and from just under 100 pounds to more than 300 pounds. The proportion and appearance of their limbs and features differ widely, but fleshwarps functionally have two legs, two arms, and a single head; a fleshwarp with more limbs than this should consider an appropriate ancestry feat to reflect this variance, or one of their limbs might be vestigial and mostly nonfunctional. Fleshwarps differ widely in their appearance due to the unique circumstances of their creation. Even fleshwarp siblings or two people transformed through the same procedure might look wildly different."]},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":89,"name":"Society","entries":["Fleshwarps are so few in number that congregations of them are rare. They most often live on their own, with a small family group, or at the outskirts of a community. Some thrive in cities, however, where they can remain anonymous among the crowds while pursuing careers that allow them to avoid contact with people who might fear or persecute them.","Fleshwarps value endurance and are quick to learn from others, so those who come into contact with others of their kind usually share stories that help each other survive, hide, or thrive more effectively. How a fleshwarp formed can be a painful or horrifying subject, one they consider rude to discuss with anyone besides close friends or loved ones."]},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":89,"name":"Alignment and Religion","entries":["Fleshwarps have little to gain from the broader society, and therefore rarely work to support society in turn, beyond perhaps helping other fleshwarps. They need to be able to adapt quickly to survive on their own. As a consequence, few fleshwarps are lawful. Although bigoted or short-sighted people view fleshwarps as monsters, fleshwarps are no more or less prone to evil than any other people, and most seek only to live their lives without trouble. Most are neutral in alignment, for while alienation doesn't force a fleshwarp to feel contempt for others, neither does it encourage a fleshwarp to avoid it. This is especially true for fleshwarps living in the societies that gave birth to their traumatic transformation. Fleshwarps aren't often casually religious; most either have little to do with faith at all (viewing themselves as scorned by the gods or simply seeing faith as impractical for survival) or are exceptionally devout. Religious fleshwarps often revere Arazni, Calistria, Desna, or Gozreh; evil fleshwarps typically turn to Lamashtu, finding consolation in the Mother of Monsters."]},{"type":"pf2-h3","page":89,"name":"Names","entries":["Fleshwarps can come from—and thus have names from—any culture or ancestry, but some give themselves new names after being transformed, whether to celebrate the change, recognize a new phase of their lives, or conceal their past identity. Many fleshwarps also carry a descriptive nickname granted to them by others, such as \"Triple Handed,\" \"Barkfoot,\" or \"Many-Mouth.\" Fleshwarps don't keep nicknames they find personally offensive, but they tend to keep ones that describe their distinctive appearances or that are given by people they care about."]},{"type":"pf2-h4","page":89,"name":"Sample Names","entries":["Borble, Dag, Feff, Hurn, Kemp, Omber, Ostro, Shurni, Surm, Wumpin"]},{"type":"pf2-sidebar","page":90,"name":"Fleshwarp Adventurers","entries":["Fleshwarps often live on the margins of society.

A number of different organizations and effects in Golarion produce fleshwarps, and one of a fleshwarp's most important aspects—beyond appearance or attitude—is their origin, which influences both their form and their attitude toward the world.","Fleshwarps fall into two major groups: those born a member of a different ancestry and transformed into a fleshwarp or those born as a fleshwarp, knowing no other existence. The former sometimes hide their new forms, seeking shelter among their prior society with those open-minded enough to shield them from the less understanding—though unfortunately, there are no guarantees that their friends and family members will be protectors, rather than persecutors. These fleshwarps know best how to blend into their erstwhile societies and might go undiscovered for a long period of time. Fleshwarps born into their warped forms generally have a more difficult upbringing and were likely often forced to fend for themselves, particularly if rejected by parents who considered their form blasphemous or ill-fated.

Adding to these disparate origins, scant uniformity exists for fleshwarps' physical features, except for those literally built to certain designs. One fleshwarp might have limbs swathed in brilliantly plumed patagia to glide on the surge winds.
