				"Androids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria. While some android survivors of this crash still walk Golarion today, most were created from the technological pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the starship's wreckage. Androids birthed from these mechanical wombs possess mature bodies and newborn souls, both organic and synthetic; they emerge knowing only their creators' language and the motor skills necessary for survival. They have no understanding of their surroundings, origin, or purpose. Most learn how to behave through keen observation while wandering Numeria.",
				"Androids tend to be logical introverts, rational and contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to understand themselves and the world around them, androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds, they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.",
				"If you want a character that's a synthetic foreigner in a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality and society through the powers of observation and logic alone, you should play an android.",

						"Androids were created in humanity's image; thus, foundries produce androids that represent all humankind. Androids display great diversity in coloration and ethnicity, height and body shape, and gender identity. Androids breathe, eat, and sleep like a human, although they're incapable of biological procreation. Their bodies contain microscopic nanites, transported by fluid too watery to be blood, that manage their organic processes. These nanites are controlled through biological circuitry that resembles tattoos and is typically located along an android's hands, forearms, face, or neck. Many androids can harness their nanites to increase their bodies' efficiency, causing the circuitry to glow.",
						"Androids don't grow old. Instead, their organic appearance becomes less convincing over time, causing them to look more artificial. After a century, most androids feel their time coming to an end and willingly release their souls to the Boneyard to face Pharasma's judgment. Their bodies then shut down, entering a lifeless hibernation as their nanites begin restoration protocol and reset their synthetic bodies to their original manufactured state. After a few weeks, a new soul enters the android's form, triggering reinitialization. This process, called Renewal, is an event to be celebrated, akin to bearing a child. Those that die by violence can't Renew, so androids go to great lengths to protect themselves and their brethren from harm."

Such groups often remain small by necessity; while a pair of androids can avoid danger through careful secrecy, large groups attract too much attention.",

The slopes of Silver Mount house multiple android enclaves and archaeological teams, including Enseffa, the center of Androffan society. In the town of Hajoth Hakados, the locals help androids secretly flee Numeria for lands where they face less hatred. Hidden in a series of tunnels and caverns beneath the Numerian Plains, the androids of Szamrak's Haven believe androids are a superior life-form. They hunt for foundries with the intent of liberating all androids, conquering Numeria to found an android-only nation, and eventually returning their people to their home amongst the stars."

First are the nefarious Technic League, greedy spellcasters who claim all technology in Numeria as their own; under Technic League rule, androids lived enslaved as technological marvels for the curious to disassemble and understand. Second are the local Kellids, who believe all technology must be buried or destroyed\u2014androids included. But change has come to Numeria. The Technic League is shattered, and the spellcasters that remain have allied with local gangs and warlords. Most Kellids still view androids as taboo but no longer kill them on sight. In the hinterlands, some citizens are slowly shaking loose their fear and prejudice, as the faiths of Casandalee and Brigh pave the way for reconciliation. A few leaders, including the Black Sovereign, have offered androids the hand of friendship, welcoming them into their lives and communities.

They seek not just knowledge, but information of their former home of Androffa to revive their lost culture. Androffans delve into technological ruins for clues to their people's past and purpose, to hunt for foundries, and to unlock the mysteries of space travel. They wear clothing and jewelry modeled on attire scavenged from starship wreckage: work boots, flight suits, wristbands, identification cards, and military insignia. Unlike most android enclaves, some Androffans live within the ruins they explore. Most individuals are nomadic, traveling from site to site to perform archaeological excavations, but the largest groups are sedentary, living along the slopes of Silver Mount in the effective heart of Androffan society."

Many-Souled androids that choose to form life-bonds with another android\u2014typically bonds of friendship, love, or mentorship\u2014swap nanites, each urging clouds of nanites to leave their bodies and reenter the body of their intended.
