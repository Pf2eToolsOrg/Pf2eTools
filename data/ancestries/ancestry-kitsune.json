				"Kitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a fox-headed humanoid and one largely depending on where they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a tailless form\u2014a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox. Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live among people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters.",

Those Souko kitsune who live outside of Kihime walk among the settlements of northern Minkai and eastern Hongal, where they liaise with other mortal peoples on behalf of the spirits. Their cultural emphasis on ambassadorship means Souko kitsune tend to strongly separate their internal and outwardly expressed feelings, modulating their expressions based on the audience. Similarly, Souko kitsune tend to remain in tailless form when among other ancestries out of a desire to present a more familiar face. Many kitsune believe that Souko kitsune are closest to the Nine Bright Grains\u2014the originators of the kitsune people that legend states Daikitsu sent to the Material Plane\u2014and almost all are faithful Daikitsuns, incorporating many of the Lady of Foxes' rites into their everyday society.
