While it's unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, this lineage manifests in modern gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete.

Gnomes latch onto a source of localized magic where they live, typically primal magic, as befits their fey lineage, but this isn't enough to avoid the Bleaching unless they supplement this magic with new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color\u2014literally\u2014from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.",

Gnomes have little culture that they would consider entirely their own. No gnome kingdoms or nations exist on the surface of Golarion, and gnomes wouldn't know what to do with such a state if they had one.",

						"Millennia ago, gnomes were among the many fey creatures cavorting about the First World, a realm of abundant light, life, and remorseless fancy. However, a long-forgotten event led to many gnomes' fleeing from their ancestral home. Banished to a world bound by cause and effect and physical limitations, the gnomes of Golarion struggled to adapt\u2014not just to find food and shelter, but to retain their identity and supernatural grip on life. With their connection to the First World severed, gnomes began withering slowly, bleeding their color, curiosity, and vitality in a process known as the Bleaching. Only by engaging in new and wondrous experiences can gnomes sustain their minds and stave off this ancestral curse, recapturing just enough of the whimsy of their lost homeland to survive\u2014and even thrive.",
						"Although the Material Plane initially seemed lethally drab by comparison to the First World, gnomes have adapted to their new environment. In addition to their natural curiosity and creativity driving them to explore every possible niche available, gnome infants form innate connections to the supernatural features that suffuse their surroundings. Like dry sponges, gnomes absorb elements of arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic, partially filling the voids left from the absence of their connection to the First World. These energies also shape a young gnome's features, coloration, personality, and innate magic, often causing children to diverge dramatically from their parents' natures based on where they grew up. Thanks to gnomes' penchants for traveling, the majority of any gnome community can share a number of physiological traits while still having a motley assortment of appearances. Individual gnomes' appearance span the full range of human eye, skin, and hair colorations and beyond, including shades of green, blue, pink, purple, and other hues. The color of these features are most vibrant early in a gnome's life, growing slightly more subdued with age.",
						"The need for novelty drives many of a gnome's actions. Periods of idleness are harmless and even refreshing, yet weeks, months, or years without some goal, project, or other stimulus to fuel a gnome's imagination leaves them vulnerable to the dreaded Bleaching. Whereas on the First World, any energy lost would quickly be replaced by that plane's ubiquitous wonders, on the Material Plane, a gnome's innate magic gradually seeps into their surroundings in a losing battle, much as a warm body inevitably loses heat in cold weather. Most gnomes can't perceive this transfer as anything other than additional anxiety or stress. Engagement and activity cause a gnome to generate enough magic to counteract this loss, but once a gnome's succumbed too far, the final stages of the Bleaching drain their remaining color over a span of several years. The process is painful and typically lethal, though a tiny fraction survives to become so-called Bleachlings, strangely calm and pale gnomes that most other gnomes view with fearful respect.",
						"Thanks to their natural curiosity, sharp senses, stubborn resourcefulness, and sheer tenacity, gnomes make natural adventurers who thrive in a variety of roles. Combined with their long lifespans, gnomes often accumulate an eclectic array of semipractical skills that can prove unexpectedly useful, and few develop the same depths of expertise in esoteric subjects as gnomes."

						"Gnomes do not have traditional ethnicities as humans might categorize them. The prevailing magical forces of an area shape gnomes' appearances and dispositions as much as conventional genetics do. As a result, a region's gnomes drift toward common traits that are largely independent of actual lineage. In some cases, these shared features happen to overlap closely with those of other major humanoid populations\u2014for example, the gnomes of Katapesh and Nex tend to have skin and hair reminiscent of their Keleshite and Garundi neighbors\u2014while in others, gnomes' bright features or uncommon complexions set them apart from everyone else.",
						"Gnomes' penchant for experimentation and innovation also means their culture is constantly changing. Cherished traditions are as likely to be centuries old as they are to have been fashioned the previous year, and the shifting of a settlement's composition regularly upsets any academic understanding of that population's customs. What's more, gnomes often adopt local conventions, often for the simple reason of bringing variety to their own routines. Even so, there are just enough cultural similarities among gnomes of common backgrounds that they can still be categorized into ethnographic groups: fell gnomes, Feychild gnomes, glimmer gnomes, and Keenspark gnomes.",
						"Nearly every gnome's top priority is staving off the Bleaching. This survivalist urge is less an immediate goal as it is an inspiration for how gnomes approach their lives. Many seek out the most wondrous experiences they can, periodically uprooting and pursuing some exciting opportunity in another land. Other gnomes find depth and meaning in a craft, study, or profession, ever seeking new discoveries and minutiae to keep their minds engaged. There's an irony that gnomes often relish particularly dangerous jobs as a way of staying in good health. This often drives gnomes to become adventurers, not just to overcome constant danger, but also to see new lands and meet eclectic companions.",
						"Unlike halflings, who often blend into other societies, gnomes thrive when standing out, from attracting the type of trouble that makes for a good story later to establishing credentials so that they may be recognized for their achievements. As a result, gnomes are often polarizing. A magnet for mischief might be endearing to some but frustrating to others, and tales of gnome tricksters both capture the imagination and fuel misconceptions held by members of other ancestries. Dwarves are often quick to view gnome behaviors\u2014particularly the iconoclastic antics of Feychild gnomes\u2014as a threat to dwarven traditions, even while dwarves and gnomes often bond over their shared adoration of good craftsmanship. Elves' shared longevity and appreciation for the natural world often help them connect with gnomes. Because halflings, half-orcs, half-elves, and goblins lack true homelands of their own, gnomes often find common ground with these peoples while exploring the world, discovering niches where they can thrive and adopting trusted comrades as surrogate families.",
