In more recent years, some half-elven philosophers and artists have pushed the idea of the Soul's Homeland\u2014that half-elves are not simply half human and half elven, but something wholly unique, adaptable yet understanding, which will one day blossom into its own society and nation.",
								"Half-elf identities are complicated, as they encompass both their human and elven nationality and heritage. Half-elf ethnicities include the Gateborn, descended from Aiudeen elves; Snowborn, descended from Ilverani; Mistborn, descended from Mualijae; Spireborn, descended from Spiresworn; Hollowborn, descended from drow; and Shoreborn, descended from aquatic elves. How half-elves relate to the elven side of their ancestry frequently depends on their elven heritage. Hollowborn are widely scorned and often must claw for every advantage to survive. Meanwhile, Mistborn and Spireborn hold valued roles as interpreters and lorekeepers among the Ekujae and as ambassadors and spies for the Spiresworn, respectively."

								"In northern Avistan, half-orcs tell the story of how the goddess Pharasma, exasperated by all the souls that came to her from every clash of orc and human, directed that a portion be returned as the children of the two species, to spare her the trouble of sorting them. Farther south, half-orcs claim that the Lord of Iron, Gorum, was a half-orc, and allowed humans and orcs to mix so that he could be born. Regardless, half-orcs are born from humans, orcs, and half-orcs, with many half-orcs the children of two half-orc parents. They stand 6 or 7 feet tall, broad-shouldered and heavily muscled, with greenish -gray skin, dark hair, and tusk-like canine teeth.",
								"Half-orcs often find commonality in their shared struggles. Humans and orcs have rarely gotten along, and so most half-orcs endure prejudice, racism, and sometimes outright slavery among human societies\u2014though after the orcs of Belkzen rose up against the recently revived Whispering Tyrant, this conflict has somewhat lessened. This prejudice has resulted in a growing culture that prizes self-sufficiency and competition, as well as argument and debate\u2014after all, words are one of the hardest things to take away. Some half-orcs are fortunate enough to live in societies that prize them; in the martial Shoanti and Ulfen cultures, for example, skin color is less important than the ability to heft an axe."

						"A half-orc is the offspring of a human and an orc, or of two half-orcs. Because some intolerant people see orcs as more akin to monsters than people, they sometimes hate and fear half-orcs simply due to their lineage. This commonly pushes half-orcs to the margins of society, where some find work in manual labor or as mercenaries, and others fall into crime or cruelty. Many who can't stand the indignities heaped on them in human society find a home among their orc kin or trek into the wilderness to live in peace, apart from society's judgment.",
