						"The dwarves of the Inner Sea region are a people known for their hardy builds, extensive history, and strong familial bonds. Dwarves originated from far beneath the ground: dwarven oracles ages ago received a vision of the comforting stone roofs of their home splitting to reveal a \"sky\"\u2014a concept unknown to their populace. When Earthfall occurred, marking the end of the Age of Legend, the shaking earth destroyed countless cities and the dwarven populace was devastated. While they could have rebuilt, dwarves saw this as a sign from their patron deity, Torag. They traveled upward for generations, fighting their way through orc tribes and driving their foes ahead of them with each step of the ascent, in a journey now known as the Quest for Sky.",
						"After centuries, in \u20134987 ar, the great King Taargick brought the dwarven clans to the surface in 10 far-flung locales. As a testament to their accomplishment, the dwarves constructed 10 glorious cities as a reminder of where their society had come from and all that they could still accomplish. These Sky Citadels were ruled for centuries by Taargick and his descendants until orc hordes managed to overtake the citadel of Koldukar. That conflict continued as a nigh-stalemate until the empire of Tar Taargadth fell to a unified orc force in 1551 ar.",
						"In modern times, the dwarven populace has become markedly diverse in its traditions, although even the most disparate of cultures bear a reverence for past accomplishments and a drive to improve in the future. Another commonality across the vast majority of dwarves is a love and respect for its clans. Dwarves keep extensive family trees dating back millennia, carved into stone and minerals. Each clan claims a particular gemstone and its unique cut as their own, and dwarves' extensive histories mean that two clans having identical gemstones as their crest is exceptionally rare. Most dwarven clans choose a gemstone that is both abundant in their region yet rare enough to have value. These gemstones are most commonly seen in the pommels of stout knives that the dwarves call clan daggers. Every dwarf has a special clan dagger that is forged by other members of the clan in preparation for the infant dwarf's arrival and used to cut their umbilical cord at birth. Great care is put into these daggers, as superstition states an infant ashamed of their clan dagger will be more prone to sickness or death. When a dwarf reaches adolescence, they are given their clan dagger, and it becomes that dwarf's independent responsibility to keep their dagger safe. When two dwarves of different clans enter into marriage, tradition usually dictates that each dwarf shows their faith and bond by forging a sheath bearing their own clan's gemstone for their partner's dagger.",
						"Dwarven adventures are renowned for their drive to improve and the steadfast bonds they form with their allies. For a dwarf to take up the adventuring lifestyle is seen as a blessing to their clan, as dwarves would have never accomplished what they have without pushing themselves to leave comfort in favor of glory. As a result, while a dwarf who returns home finds a hero's welcome, those who never return are also viewed and remembered with pride, as they are seen to embody the determination that brought the dwarven people from deep beneath the earth all the way to their current home on the surface."

Their settlements are built into caves far beneath the earth, with the walls of important buildings such as medical offices and the homes of leaders carved with runic family trees and inset with clan gemstones to commemorate their history. As they live without a sky, underground dwarves have a different biological clock than their relatives, tending to sleep for 12 hours before remaining awake for 20. Because this is the same interval at which their forges are regularly warmed, this cycle of 32 hours is referred to as a forge-day.",

As underground dwarves are separated from the surface world, the only news of world events they receive comes from surface dwarf couriers. A millennia-old agreement mandates that surface dwarves will come belowground once every 24 forge-days to provide knowledge of current events on the surface, receiving impeccable metalworks in exchange.",

While mountain dwarves see the pursuit of glory as paramount, and surface dwarves are driven to protect their way of life, the backbone of underground dwarf society is instead the importance of safety and sanctity.
