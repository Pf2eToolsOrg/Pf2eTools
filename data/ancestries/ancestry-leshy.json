Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, and so they do not depend upon these druids for care, though it is not uncommon for leshies to maintain lifelong bonds with their creators.",
				"Not all leshies have a strong enough spirit to strike off completely on their own, however. Weaker nature spirits can form only tenuous bonds that are just strong enough to animate Tiny bodies. These spirits become leshy familiars, acting as companions to their druid creators. Independent leshies are often protective of such leshy familiars, advocating for them to be treated with dignity and respect.",

						"Leshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Due to the nature of the ritual used to create a leshy, leshies begin their lives as adults. As spirits, they do not age, and a leshy could potentially remain in the same vessel forever\u2014though leshies rarely consider this outcome to be desirable."

					"entries": [
						"Though guardian leshies often congregate, traveling leshies are not naturally drawn to others of their own kind. To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. A betrayed leshy might not directly attack those who slight them, but they might withdraw support at a critical moment or leave their betrayers to get lost in the wilderness.",
						"Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though those familiar with leshies know that this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies often take pride in their own appearances and appreciate beauty of all kinds in others, but they rarely form judgments based on physical appearance. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Leshies tend to gravitate toward plant bodies that match their genders. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely."

Some leshies also venerate green men, powerful spirits of nature that act as regional guardians."

They can be particularly challenging to spot with the untrained eye, blending in with their natural environment. The treetop settlement of Elderleaf in the Verduran Forest, the terraced fungal caverns of Nuldrig in the Darklands, and the sprawling Korwil vineyards of Taldor are three such locations. Leshies are a common sight in druid enclaves, such as Crystalhurst in Nirmathas. Adventuring leshies don't restrict themselves to such sanctums of nature, however, and can find homes in almost any settlement surrounded by the wild. Kyonin, the Mwangi Expanse, and Nirmathas are common homelands for leshies."

						"Leshys are immortal spirits of nature called into physical bodies through primal rituals. While early leshys originated as guardians of natural habitats who rarely strayed far from their birth places, a few went on perilous journeys to attack threats at their source. These wandering spirits became easier to draw into future creation rituals. With each passing generation, leshys with a penchant for adventure have become increasingly common.",
						"Leshy bodies can be made of numerous possible building blocks\u2014like petals, leaves, bark, and mushrooms. The ritual to create leshys can include almost any plant or fungus, though most are primarily built from a single species, which gives individuals their most distinctive features. Leshy scholars group these characteristics into broad categories based upon their abilities.",
						"Most common are leaf leshys. They can arise from any leafy plant but most often form from trees or shrubs. These graceful leshys tend to be boastful, enjoying mock combats and other dramatic performances. Gourd leshys have hollow spaces within their heads, which they use to store their most valuable possessions; this secure and private space makes them more likely to hold cherished keepsakes. While fungus leshys can be quite sociable with other ancestries, they tend toward introversion, needing quiet time spent in dark and cozy caverns to recover after loud events. Vine leshys, by contrast, rarely enjoy being alone. Much as vines scale trees and climb cliffs to reach for sunlight, many vine leshys thrive in the presence of friends, and they don't shy away from asking for help when they need it. Fruit leshys are similarly gregarious and tend to be nurturing and generous toward their companions\u2014sometimes too much for their own good. True to their spiny exteriors, cactus leshys are known for being abrasive, sarcastic, and slow to trust. However, those with the patience to earn a cactus leshy's friendship find themselves with an unswervingly loyal and unflinchingly honest ally. Similarly, root leshys are hard to win over, not because of their personalities, but because they tend to live at a slower pace, taking longer to warm up to others and make important decisions. Seaweed and lotus leshys often have the most patience among leshys. Carefree and playful, many seaweed leshys happily ride along with the ebb and flow of the tides. Meanwhile, lotus leshys are thoughtful and fond of dispensing wisdom in the form of cryptic advice.",
						"A newly created leshy is at once both young and ancient. They view the world with a childlike wonder and curiosity, relishing the chance to experience the world with fresh eyes once again. Though their spirits may be ancient beyond the reckoning of most ancestries, leshys consciously recall little of previous lifetimes. Leshys typically find the significance most ancestries attach to numerical age a curiosity\u2014they understand that many creatures have childhoods during which they gradually mature and gain vital knowledge of themselves and the world around them, but they also struggle to comprehend what makes an elderly noblewoman who has lived a life of luxury and indulgence much different from her grandchildren. Still, the past has a powerful impact on a leshy's spirit, shaping their personality, interests, and priorities.",
						"As spirits who can experience many lifetimes and forms, leshy ethnicities aren't determined by their physical bodies, origins, or familial bonds, but by their spirit's affinity for particular cultural traits. Guardians of the Green take their traditional role as protectors to heart and are the most likely to worship green men. Reflective leshys value honesty and clear-eyed introspection; they're particularly sensitive to changes around and within them, such as the cycle of seasons and the ways they grow from their experiences, though they often embrace these changes and revel in their beauty, content to spend hours in meditation. Ritualist leshys are collectors. In addition to gathering objects significant to their current lives, they also proclaim the hidden power in other objects. Sometimes dismissed as mere superstition, these pronouncements are typically rooted either in their innate sense of other nature spirits or in faint memories of their past lives. Sunbeam leshys value diplomacy and alliance-building. Best known for their cheerful dispositions, sunbeams aren't without guile. Many willingly use trickery or manipulation to avoid conflicts or to secure advantages. Hot-headed and quick-thinking thornspark leshys are the first to spring into action against anyone who would dare to threaten their allies or wards. Wandersoul leshys constantly seek out new experiences, often spending their lives as travelers, explorers, and storytellers.",
						"Leshy bodies don't age and are theoretically immortal. With such long lifespans, even the most daring leshys find value in periods of patient reflection. They typically remain the guardian of a single location for many years. Most leshys eventually lose their bodies to violence or mishap, exploding in a verdant burst that nourishes the life around them. Leshys value their lives, but they don't hold the same fear of death that plagues other ancestries; they know that once their bodies fall, their spirits will return to the natural world. Indeed, leshys rarely wish to live forever in the same form. As the centuries pass, a leshy who has lived a rich life full of new experiences and insights gradually spends more time in reflection and meditation. At the culmination of these reflections, their spirit flies back to rejoin other spirits of nature, ready to absorb all that it has learned and begin the cycle anew.",
						"Leshy spirits can be transformed by the strong influence of other planes of existence or sources of energy. For example, a leshy spirit continually exposed to an artifact from Heaven might take on characteristics based on Heaven's lush gardens in its next body, gaining the {@ancestry leshy|locg|aasimar versatile heritage|aasimar|apg}. Similarly, a spirit given form in an area corrupted by negative energy might become a {@ancestry leshy|locg|dhampir|dhampir|apg}.",
						"Leshy kinship groups are based on mutual bonds of loyalty and trust rather than biological relationships. When leshys gather with others of their kind, they band together in nomadic groups or long-term villages near areas of primal significance. Such groups often include a druid with knowledge of the rituals that create leshys, allowing their group to grow or even call back their lost members into new bodies. When governing themselves, leshys usually defer to expertise and wisdom rather than arbitrary classifications like wealth or social status.",
						"Leshy settlements flourish in all manner of natural locations, from forest treetops and prosperous fields to deep caverns, desert oases, and even kelp forests surrounding flourishing coral reefs. Leshys don't limit themselves to only the most pristine natural locations\u2014they can be found in nearly any corner of Golarion that supports plant life. Most leshys live among other ancestries as well as in druidic circles, frontier settlements, or even cities surrounded by lush farmlands."
