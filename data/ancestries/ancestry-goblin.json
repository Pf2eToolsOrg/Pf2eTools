						"Goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.",

Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.",
						"Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as \"longshanks,\" won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. However, their attitude as a people is changing rapidly, and their short lifespans and poor memories help them adapt quickly."

While all goblins have a natural tendency toward pyromania, forest goblins are often far more knowledgeable on the subject than almost any other species. Since forest goblins traditionally produce far fewer primal or divine spellcasters than other goblin ethnicities, they have developed a deep tradition of fire-management practices, taught through song and practical application. There is even evidence to suggest that woodlands inhabited by forest goblins are less prone to disastrous wildfires thanks to the goblins regularly burning away dead wood and dry brush that might otherwise act as fuel for hungry flames.",
