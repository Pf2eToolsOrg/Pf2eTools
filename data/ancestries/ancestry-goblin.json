Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.",

						"Goblins legends claim that the first goblins on Golarion were born from the human blood spilled by the barghests Hadregash, Venkelvore, Zarongel, and Zogmugot. Each of these barghests gave the goblins a gift to help them prosper. From Hadregash came the gift of tribe, making goblins stronger in numbers. Venkelvore gave goblins a bottomless hunger that drove them to spread out across the world. Zarongel, the most bestial of the barghests, granted an affinity to the predators who shared the goblins' inclinations, such as goblin dogs and wolves, so that goblins excelled at riding these creatures and could fight and travel more quickly. Finally, Zogmugot taught the goblins the secrets of the shores, how to scrounge, fish, and seek, so they could scavenge and survive no matter where they found themselves.",
						"Over time, goblins spread across Golarion, and today they can be found across the Inner Sea region, from the sweltering jungles of Mediogalti Island to the frozen and blighted forests of Iobaria. Goblins have even found homes on the distant continents of Arcadia and Tian Xia, their clever instinct for survival allowing them to thrive even in the most hostile of environments. In fact, goblins are no strangers to hostility; whether bullied by and recruited as disposable shock troops for their larger hobgoblin and bugbear kin or mercilessly wiped out by adventurers who see them as little more than pests to be exterminated, goblin lives are, more often than not, short and full of hardship.",
						"Despite the overwhelmingly negative perception most other peoples have of goblins, the small people have begun to find places among other societies, primarily in human cities and towns. While cities like Magnimar have long tolerated the goblin tribes that occupy their sewers, viewing them as a convenient cleaning service preventing disease-bearing rats or dangerous otyughs from proliferating, there are more and more areas where goblins can walk openly on the streets without fear of being skewered by guards or frightened farmers. On the sun-scorched streets of Katapesh, a tribe of Rasp goblins maintain a thriving mercantile enterprise under the leadership of an elderly goblin known by the name Yigrig Moneymaker. Operating in the northern lands of Irrisen, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, and even the southern edge of the Crown of the World, a band of frost goblins recruited by the Pathfinder Society acts as a team of scouts and guides for the Society's members and allies. In the land of Sarkoris, a cunning tribe of forest goblins fights alongside a tribe of Sarkorian refugees looking to reclaim their homeland from the demons and monsters that infest it. Goblin arsonists are proclaimed heroes and allies by human generals as goblin-brewed alchemical fires sear the undead forces crawling forth from the Eye of Dread. Even goblin cutpurses scrounging their living in alleys find themselves recruited by enterprising adventurers who recognize the value of an alliance with a clever sneak whose survival instincts have been honed by untold generations of hardship and persecution. Their means and circumstances vary greatly, but goblins across Golarion have begun to carve a niche for themselves where they can be accepted.",

While all goblins have a natural tendency toward pyromania, forest goblins are often far more knowledgeable on the subject than almost any other species. Since forest goblins traditionally produce far fewer primal or divine spellcasters than other goblin ethnicities, they have developed a deep tradition of fire-management practices, taught through song and practical application. There is even evidence to suggest that woodlands inhabited by forest goblins are less prone to disastrous wildfires thanks to the goblins regularly burning away dead wood and dry brush that might otherwise act as fuel for hungry flames.",

										"Rasp goblins have inhabited the southern and western reaches of Varisia for longer than any of the country's human inhabitants, resulting in frequent conflict as humans push deeper and deeper into the goblins' ancestral territory. Encounters with particularly aggressive and malevolent goblin communities mean that pioneer towns like Sandpoint often view goblins as little more than dangerous pests, and hire guards and adventurers to drive off any nearby goblins out of a sense of public safety. As a result, though their population numbers remain somewhat stable, Rasp goblins rarely have anything resembling clan elders or even anyone in their communities with more than a few years of knowledge or experience. This in turn means that the teaching songs goblins traditionally use to pass on their lore and skills are largely lost to the Rasp goblin tribes, who retain little more than war songs and death chants. Their aversion to literacy and lack of elders has lead to many Rasp goblins living and dying in a state of perpetual childhood, which\u2014perhaps due to the frequent conflicts between Rasp goblin tribes and other peoples\u2014has led to the spread of a number of unfortunate stereotypes not only about Rasp goblins, but about all goblins, such as the assertion that all goblins are bloodthirsty raiders, murderers, and Lamashtu worshippers.
