Though lizardfolk have adapted to many different environments, many of them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As a result, lizardfolk usually prefer equipment that is not easily damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone.",

They live across Avistan, especially in the west, though they've lost much of their historic territory to other ancestries. Family trees are vital to Essari culture. Every Essari can recite their clan lineage, and the bones of their precursors likely fortified the walls of their childhood home. Even the most nontraditional Essari has a spiritual connection to their ancestors that their closest companions might never suspect\u2014until it saves their lives.

								"Rasp goblins, or simply \"Rasps,\" named after the section of Varisia's Lost Coast where they tend to live, are some of the most commonly encountered goblins in the Inner Sea region, particularly in Varisia and the neighboring nations. Unlike frost goblins and monkey goblins, who are limited to smaller geographic areas, and forest goblins, who suffered terrible population losses during the Goblinblood Wars, Rasp goblins remain exceptionally populous and can quickly spread to any area that is vaguely capable of sustaining life. Rasp goblins stand just over 3 feet tall and weigh roughly 35 pounds. While many Rasp goblins are some shade of green (typically lighter and sicklier shades than their forest goblin cousins), some Rasp goblins have rarer skin colors, such as gray or purple.",
								"Rasp goblins have inhabited the southern and western reaches of Varisia for longer than any of the country's human inhabitants, resulting in frequent conflict as humans push deeper and deeper into the goblins' ancestral territory. Encounters with particularly aggressive and malevolent goblin communities mean that pioneer towns like Sandpoint often view goblins as little more than dangerous pests, and hire guards and adventurers to drive off any nearby goblins out of a sense of public safety. As a result, though their population numbers remain somewhat stable, Rasp goblins rarely have anything resembling clan elders or even anyone in their communities with more than a few years of knowledge or experience. This in turn means that the teaching songs goblins traditionally use to pass on their lore and skills are largely lost to the Rasp goblin tribes, who retain little more than war songs and death chants. Their aversion to literacy and lack of elders has lead to many Rasp goblins living and dying in a state of perpetual childhood, which\u2014perhaps due to the frequent conflicts between Rasp goblin tribes and other peoples\u2014has led to the spread of a number of unfortunate stereotypes not only about Rasp goblins, but about all goblins, such as the assertion that all goblins are bloodthirsty raiders, murderers, and Lamashtu worshippers. By contrast, however, those Rasp goblins who've had the opportunity to integrate with other cultures have begun to paint a very different and improved picture of their people.",
