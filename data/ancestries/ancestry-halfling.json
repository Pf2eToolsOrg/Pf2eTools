In some cases, these divisions were fueled by separation and circumstances, such as the oppressed halflings of Cheliax who have been forced into slavery, and the Song'o halflings of the Mwangi Expanse, who hid from all other cultures to avoid a similar fate. Other halflings, such as the Jaric, Mihrini, Othoban, and Uhlam halflings, simply formed their own traditions without the influence of humans and other creatures."

								"The halflings of the Inner Sea region primarily developed alongside the people around them. Halflings living alongside other ancestries soon mimicked these groups in more than just cultures and traditions. These halflings developed into cultures and ethnicities that were distinctly halfling, yet quite similar to those of the other peoples with whom they shared their lives. Many halfling ethnicities are thus close reflections of other ancestries' ethnicities, with halflings sharing the same physiology and cultural traditions of their compatriots, who are often humans.

Others serve as household slaves, often as cooks or valets; these slaves typically are required to perform less arduous tasks but suffer frequent abuse and dreadful personal accommodations, as when forced to sleep in cupboards. In Cheliax, halflings are derisively called \"slips,\" and their cramped slave quarters are called \"slip kennels.\" Legal punishments for beating, mutilating, or killing a halfling in Cheliax are appallingly light and classified as property crimes, even when perpetrated against the nation's few free halflings.",
										"Halflings in Cheliax often band together for protection, such as by working hard to cover for a sick comrade or sharing the burden of an unfair punishment. Halflings take joy in spending time with family, even when they live as slaves, and their desire to protect their family members is, unfortunately, something cruel overseers learn to exploit. A halfling slave who betrays another for personal gain is labeled an \"impkin\" among them and earns a reputation so tainted that most impkin are essentially ostracized by all other halflings."

Their skin is deeply tanned and weathered from spending most of their lives outdoors, and their bodies are slightly shorter and stockier compared to other halflings. Jarics are particularly muscular due to traversing the cliffs and rock walls of the Barrier Wall. This prowess steers Jarics toward more physical pursuits such as combat, with many Jaric children growing up wrestling one another for fun. The rough nature of their endeavors leaves many Jarics with black eyes or scars, something they wear with pride. Jarics sport dark brown eyes and darker hair colors, such as black and brown. They enjoy adopting bombastic hair styles and\u2014among men\u2014impressive facial hair. Jarics tend to wear loose-fitting clothing that permits a wide range of physical movement, although they prefer to eschew clothing altogether when doing so won't make their neighbors uncomfortable."

In addition, the hair on their feet tends to be finer and lighter than that of other halflings. Eye colors among Mihrinis tend to be on the lighter side, with blues and grays being most common. Mihrinis prefer many-layered clothing, particularly garments with several buttons in different styles and textures.

										"With the return of Xin-Edasseril and the rise of New Thassilon near Varisia came a number of Thassilonian people displaced from time.

Their displacement preserved their unique traits, such as their range of skin tones from pale to dusky. Othoban hair is typically wavy, with colors as varied as their skin, though they are unable to grow facial hair except for thin sideburns. Much like other Thassilonians, Othobans like to wear the latest styles and enjoy having multiple outfits to choose from, often overspending on clothing.

Unlike most halflings, who adopt the culture of the humanoids near them, Song'o halflings are reclusive and keep their own traditions. Already cautious due to the prevalent dangers of their jungle home, the Chelaxian establishment of the former colony of Sargava taught the Song'o to distrust and flee from outsiders. Today, with the overthrow of that government and the founding of Vidrian, Song'o are just beginning to explore beyond their own communities once more. They still distrust unfamiliar people, prefer to stay out of sight and observe their surroundings, and readily uproot their temporary villages and relocate to new regions deeper in the jungle if they suspect danger is nearby.",
										"Because of their skittishness and reluctance to interact with others, Song'o halflings preserve a rich and ancient culture that developed in isolation in the Laughing Jungle. They enjoy fleeting art, such as music made with impromptu items, or sculptures of earth and leaves. Song'o halflings share the dark skin of their Mwangi human neighbors, with black or dark-brown eyes and dark, curly hair. Most Song'o halflings like to paint their bodies, especially their faces, and they enjoy showing off their designs to others, although they are reluctant to compliment even skillful work because they think compliments bring bad luck. They are very fond of flowers and use them to adorn their homes, wagons, and clothing. Song'o halflings wear multiple layers of patterned clothing when possible, with stories about how each layer provides protection from predators, insects, or weather. From a practical standpoint, however, these layers must be lightweight so the halflings don't overheat in their warm jungle; their gauzy but resilient clothing is particularly prized by the few traders who have befriended Song'o halflings. They don't tend toward any particular class, but usually have the {@ancestry halfling||Wildwood halfling|wildwood} heritage."
