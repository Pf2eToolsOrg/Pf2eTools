Now that the {@plane Plane of Wood|RoE} has returned, many of these lost ardande families are experiencing a resurgence of their old elemental heritage, though they have little more than legends and folk stories of an ancestor's elemental power to explain and offer guidance for their new generation of ardande children.

						"Undines often go through life in a series of shifting phases, their interests waxing, waning, or sometimes morphing altogether as old loves are discarded for new interests. Structure provides a much-needed focus to undines' lives, and without strong goals or support from those around them, undines can find themselves stagnating in feelings of despondence. Most undines feel they personify specific aspects of water, some seeing themselves with the strength and power of the waves, the speed and tenacity of a river current, or the calm of a peaceful lake or pond. Others identify with all these aspects and more, their demeanors shifting like the tides from one situation to the next.",
						"Undines born with a connection only to a specific subtype of elemental water, such as ice, brine, or mist, might have a specific undine lineage. These are typically passed down from parent to child, as with other geniekin, but on occasion, a child is born with a lineage never seen in their family. Sometimes lineages are the result of where an undine's ancestors lived, such as rimesoul undines being born in the cold northern countries or at the tops of mountain peaks. At other times it can be related to the undine's elemental heritage, as is often the case with brinesoul undines, who usually descend from brine dragons. Mistsoul undines might have a distant but powerful connection to elemental water, or might even have a bit of elemental air mixed into their ancestry.",

								"With all the same diversity in height, body type, and physical characteristics as any other member of their ancestries, undine coloration runs a vast breadth of variation. Most commonly, an undine's skin and hair mimic the colors of the lakes, seas, or oceans near where they were born, ranging from the palest of blues to sea greens and navies. A rare few undines may even take on the bioluminescence of deep-sea fish, the bright colors of corals and anemones, or the pale bone hues of seashells. More unusual traits can include fin-like ears, thin layers of shimmering fish scales covering their bodies, coral growths at their joints or temples, tails with caudal fins, and even webbed hands and feet."

								"Unlike other geniekin, undines create and congregate within their own tightly knit communities near water or floating on top of it. Undine neighborhoods that develop within larger cities, typically near the docks or directly on the water, are informally known as flotillas. Because undines deliberately create and seek out these communities, their children usually have healthy childhoods focused on the values of fellowship and harmony. This stands in contrast to many other planar scions, who all-too-often grow up feeling like outsiders.",

Some undines worship deities of water, such as {@deity Gozreh} or {@deity Hei Feng}, while others might offer their prayers to {@deity Lysianassa}, the lost elemental lord of water."
