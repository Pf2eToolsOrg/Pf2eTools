Most aasimars are good, whether because society tends to accept, foster, and support aasimars, or because the influence of the celestial planes is enough to subtly encourage them down such paths. Good faiths are more likely to draw an aasimar's attention, particularly those with portfolios associated with celestial concerns, such as Desna, Erastil, or Sarenrae.

These mortal beings are shaped by incredible celestial power and are often greeted as omens of good fortune for the communities they're born into. As adults, many aasimars gravitate towards noble and heroic principles, often finding success as renowned artists, devout clergy, and resplendent heroes. A celestial tether holds an aasimar's soul close, gently pulling them towards celestial ideals. Aasimars feel subtle urges to root out evil, aid the downtrodden, and amend society's broken promises. This pull is not a guarantee for a life of good, however, and many aasimars crack under the pressure put upon them. These aasimars might prefer to escape the expectations of their lives and choose to live in solitude. In other cases, an aasimar might turn to a life of evil, either as a backlash for failing to live up to these societal pressures or as a rejection of their own celestial nature.",
								"Physically, an aasimar's appearance greatly resembles others of their ancestry, though their celestial influence can visibly manifest in nearly imperceptible to substantial cosmetic differences. Common manifestations include pearlescent teeth, golden hair, lyrical voices, floral scents, and shining features. More radical manifestations can include additional eyes, bodies covered in soft down feathers, a voice that sounds akin to several people speaking in unison, or heads with more than a single face. These differences are far less common and, for some, unnerving; many would consider these aasimars monstrous if not for their natural aura of holiness."

Idyllkin aasimars appear often among halfling communities, as agathions resonate with halflings' contentedness. An aasimar halfling may smell like a different dessert depending on their mood, be covered in thick lamb's wool, or grow long rabbit ears as an expression of their celestial heritage.",
								"Humans have a long history of beseeching celestials in times of need. In Thuvia, angelic peris work alongside human champions to quell demonic div insurrections. In Mendev, angels spent lifetimes battling alongside mortals against demonic hordes. In Tianjing, outside the Inner Sea, a host of quartered celestials changed the fabric of a nation after defending it from vile qlippoth forces.

								"Mortal, yet descended from immortals; living, but irrevocably shaped by undeath: dhampirs exist in a liminal space between two opposing forces. Many superstitious folk would say these half-dead, vampire-descended creatures shouldn't exist at all\u2014but exist they do, despite their often-violent origins, carving out lives for themselves among all ancestries and across all cultures.",
								"In most ways, dhampirs resemble their mortal parents. They retain their ancestry's size, general shape and build, and distinguishing features such as pointed ears, pronounced jawlines, thick facial hair, and the like. They hail from all ethnicities and all parts of the world, but a dhampir's skin and hair are always an ashen, bloodless reflection of their mortal parent's, lacking the warm tones that indicate life and vitality. Born with a hunger distinct from most mortal appetites, dhampirs trend toward slighter builds than their mortal counterparts. Their eyes are often colorless, with only pinpoint pupils, though some instead have gray, silver, or red eyes. Despite these eerie characteristics, most dhampirs embody an entrancing combination of physical grace and subtle charm.",
								"Given their unusual origins, it's no surprise that dhampir societies are all but unheard of. Complex families occasionally form when a single vampire gives rise to several dhampir siblings, but most dhampirs exist in isolation. In the best of cases, a dhampir is raised as part of their mortal parent's society and faces all the prejudice that community bears toward a half-living child. Those born to strife and violence are often orphaned, abandoned, or cast out. Their eerie mannerisms and long lifespans only exacerbate the difficulties they face when integrating into a community, causing most dhampirs to keep their distance and remain detached from those around them.",
								"Dhampirs are outsiders in most cultures, and many find kinship among other people of mixed ancestry: half-elves and half-orcs, tieflings, changelings, and similar types. Rarely, small communities of dhampirs form in the shadows of particularly large cities or in wild hinterlands far from settled regions.",
								"To some extent, a dhampir's existence is predicated upon death and bloodshed; even in the best of circumstances, their vampire parent's very nature compels them to feed upon the living, and many dhampirs have more sinister origins. This reality leaves dhampirs prone to feelings of guilt and indebtedness, which almost always have some sort of influence on their outlook, but otherwise a dhampir isn't beholden to their vampiric parent's wicked nature.",
								"Dhampirs left to fend for themselves among a hostile populace often care little for questions of morality; these individuals have learned, out of necessity, to look out only for their own interests, and if their powers over others allow them to better survive, they might as well put them to use. Some strive to prove themselves to be more than the curse of their undead lineage, even going so far as to hunt down vampires and other undead. Others enthusiastically embrace the dark side of their origin and live a life of evil. Those who uphold a faith often patronize the deities worshipped by their mortal parents, though evil dhampirs often find inspiration in Urgathoa, whispered to have been not only the first undead but in fact the first vampire."

These regions are home to the svetocher children of moroi vampires; the offspring of nosferatu vampires known as stravezeck; and the rare cel rau, descended from ancient strigoi vampires. In Tian Xia's Dragon Empires, dhampirs are most often ru-shi, descended from the breath-stealing jiang-shi vampires more common to that land. Adhyabhau dhampirs, creations of the rare vetalaranas\u2014also called psychic vampires\u2014are hardly found outside the Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra or, occasionally, Jalmeray.",

Thus, dhampir dwarves are few and far between, typically emerging in areas where dwarves have lost control of their ancestral lands. Dhampir dwarves in traditional communities must find a way to prove themselves\u2014often by becoming hunters of undead themselves\u2014lest they be cast out from their homes.",
								"Few elves would readily admit the extent to which their kind mingles with the undead masters of the night, but similarly, few elves would admit that they are just as easy prey to a vampire's charms and enchantments as any other. Elves make remarkably suitable companions for immortals, given their long lifespans, so it's no surprise that more dhampirs are born among elves than nearly any other ancestry besides humans. Dhampir elves find the pace of elf culture a suitable match for their own prolonged lifespans\u2014though these communities are rarely welcoming to their half-dead kin.",
								"Of all the ancestries dhampirs are born into, goblins are perhaps the most accepting of their half-living kin\u2014largely because goblins vary so much that the physical features of a dhampir goblin are largely unremarkable. They are admittedly less common than dhampirs of most other ancestries, and their longevity is often balanced by the fact that dhampir goblins are no less reckless or ebullient than any other goblin.",
								"As creatures suffused with vibrant life force, gnomes rarely deal with the undead, and so dhampir gnomes are remarkably rare. The infusion of undeath into such an exuberant ancestry mutes a dhampir gnome's color and vivacity, giving them an appearance and demeanor surprisingly similar to those few gnomes who have survived the Bleaching.",
								"Halflings have long lived alongside humans, whether recognized or not. Since vampires lurk most frequently among human cultures, their influence extends out among halflings as well, leading to a population of dhampir halflings that would surprise most. The close-knit nature of many halfling communities means that dhampir halflings are less ostracized and face less discrimination than dhampirs of other ancestries, and the optimism of halfling culture encourages dhampir halflings toward a friendlier, more open disposition than most.",
								"As vampires primarily exist among and draw from human cultures, dhampir humans are the most common of their kind, and they vary as much as human cultures do. Given this disparity, perhaps the only thing dhampir humans have in common is the distrust they face among most human communities, likely due to the fact that humans are a vampire's most common prey."

Duskwalkers tend to be hesitant to discuss their origins\u2014not out of shame or fear, but simply because the truth often makes people uncomfortable. Many claim unusual but ultimately mundane origins, explaining away their appearance with reference to fictional parents from far-off lands. Duskwalkers are also prone to a degree of asceticism. Gratuitous hedonism or conspicuous consumption feel somehow small in the face of death's reality, a waste of time and energy that could be better spent in other ways. They're usually companionable, understanding, and accepting of others. While incapable of having children and generally uninterested in carnal pleasures, many duskwalkers seek to build a family, often adopting children others would overlook.",

How a duskwalker reacts to that knowledge varies\u2014some idolize their past lives and seek to complete their predecessor's unfinished destiny, while others try to undo and overturn every act out of philosophical opposition. Rare, however, is the duskwalker who has only mild interest in their past self.",
								"Physically, duskwalkers tend toward the monochromatic, as their skin, hair, and eyes trend towards white, gray, black, or desaturated blue shades. Some duskwalkers have more unusual features, such as patches of scales or feathers, based on the their previous incarnation's nature and actions. Their tendency towards asceticism means that most duskwalkers dress in whatever garb is common in their lands, though the occasional stylish soul dons robes of pure white or black or takes on symbols of death.",

								"Duskwalkers of goblin ancestry are particularly rare, as fewer goblins have yet performed actions in service to the cycle of life and death. Duskwalker asceticism often causes mundane goblins to consider duskwalker goblins as \"ungobliny.\" In the reclaimed lands of the Sarkoris Scar, they are nevertheless seen as lucky, attracting death to themselves (variously defined but often personified as undead with big teeth) and thus diverting it away from other goblins.",
								"Duskwalker halflings are usually thinner than other halflings, even skeletal, and frequently have delicate features with pronounced cheekbones. The occasional duskwalker halfling to manifest in Cheliax is usually captured as a runaway and disappeared before they can be adopted or find a way to survive on their own.",
								"Duskwalker humans have the classic monochromatic palette of their kind. A few among them, especially those manifesting in Tian Xia, possess curling ram horns. Duskwalker humans appear more frequently in Ustalav, though the paranoia of that land means that many have a hard time finding homes. Such duskwalkers often live as outcast orphans in graveyards, which paradoxically makes their communities safer from the undead.",

Less fortunate tieflings grow up as outcasts or get shunned by their fearful families, left to live as street children and beggars. Some tieflings never get a chance to grow up at all.",

Many tieflings develop tricks to ward off hostility and suspicion from outsiders\u2014they might grow adept at hiding their nature, cultivate a repertoire of jokes and stories to defuse situations, or simply develop psychological armor a foot thick.",
								"On the other hand, those that do earn a tiefling's loyalty find it nearly unshakable. Tieflings know they can't afford to waste precious relationships in an oft-unfriendly world, and so cherish their friends and loved ones. A loyal tiefling will cross deserts, scale mountains, and risk dragons for a friend. This devotion isn't always a good thing, though, as sometimes those inclined to offer tieflings a warm smile and helping hand have cruel intentions or, unlike most tieflings, have been outcast for very good and sensible reasons (such as practicing demonology).",
								"No matter their lineage, tieflings also tend to have more developed philosophical viewpoints than most people. To a tiefling, good and evil aren't distant abstractions, but questions of immediate import. Can a demon's child truly be good? What does it mean to accept your devilish blood? Tieflings have as much free will as any other person in Golarion, but they don't always realize it, and more than one tiefling has embraced or raged against their heritage out of some sense of ironbound destiny.",

Fiends come in endlessly diverse shapes and forms, so when filtered through the quirks of mortal blood, the results never cease to surprise. Certain traits appear more commonly than others\u2014a slim majority of tieflings have some combination of horns, fangs, cloven hooves, tails, and oddly-colored (typically crimson) skin.

Their skin could have blue lapis coloration or zebra-like stripes or serpentine scales. They might have teeth like a wolf or a shark or a viper. Less common lineages have their own markers.

Tieflings are particularly common in devil-worshipping Cheliax, where they're still outcasts, but for a different reason\u2014rather than a forbidden evil, they're viewed as symbols of weakness in interactions with devils. To Chelaxians, a tiefling signals that someone couldn't control their diabolic powers or resist the machinations of a devil, and often are thus pitied or held in contempt.",
								"Tiefling goblins are also quite common, a consequence of the ancestry's frequent worship of Lamashtu. Tieflings in such communities often receive great respect as symbols of divine favor and for their unusually sharp and vicious teeth\u2014sometimes multiple rows of them.",
								"Other societies treat tieflings less kindly. Tiefling dwarves, usually notable for their glowing eyes of crimson flame, are rarely appreciated by their kin. For example, the Pahmet dwarves of Osirion hide, smuggle away, and occasionally even kill such tieflings at birth, believing that a tiefling symbolizes some great crime or dereliction of duty on the part of the family as a whole.",
								"Tiefling elves frequently have exceptionally long, delicate-looking horns, and occasionally more than one set. They also possess vestigial wings more often than other tieflings, though even among elves, winged tieflings remain quite rare. The Mualijae elves of Garund are no more fond of tieflings than anyone else, but they tend to take a more utilitarian approach to them; their society encourages tieflings to become warriors and demon hunters, reasoning that they couldn't possibly become more corrupted than they already are.",
								"Tieflings of halfling ancestry are most often found in Cheliax as well, but where tiefling humans are pitied, tiefling halflings are considered threats to the ruling class and often killed by the Church of Asmodeus. Other halfling slaves have decidedly mixed feelings about their fiend-blooded kin, expressing sympathy for their plight touched with horror for what they represent. Tiefling halflings frequently have hooves and forked or unusually long tongues.",
								"Tiefling gnomes aren't particularly common since their ties to the First World often serve as a sort of inoculation against fiendish corruption. When they do appear, they're frequently mistaken for fell gnomes, with whom they get along quite well. Tiefling gnomes often have peculiarly elongated fingers, sometimes with extra joints and claw-like nails\u2014such tieflings have an iron grip, despite the seeming fragility of their hands.",
								"Many tieflings live transient lives, traveling in search of work and acceptance, however temporary. Few people will go out of their way to harass a grown tiefling, particularly one that has fangs or claws or worse, but smart tieflings know that it's only a matter of time before something gets blamed on the local fiend-blood. Tieflings often gravitate to major cities as a result, seeking anonymity in urban life, or else choose the wilderness over civilization altogether. Those rare tieflings who actually find a community that wholeheartedly accepts them defend their new homes with zealous ferocity."

						"Undines often go through life in a series of shifting phases, their interests waxing, waning, or sometimes morphing altogether as old loves are discarded for new interests. Structure provides a much-needed focus to undines' lives, and without strong goals or support from those around them, undines can find themselves stagnating in feelings of despondence. Most undines feel they personify specific aspects of water, some seeing themselves with the strength and power of the waves, the speed and tenacity of a river current, or the calm of a peaceful lake or pond. Others identify with all these aspects and more, their demeanors shifting like the tides from one situation to the next.",
						"Undines born with a connection only to a specific subtype of elemental water, such as ice, brine, or mist, might have a specific undine lineage. These are typically passed down from parent to child, as with other geniekin, but on occasion, a child is born with a lineage never seen in their family. Sometimes lineages are the result of where an undine's ancestors lived, such as rimesoul undines being born in the cold northern countries or at the tops of mountain peaks. At other times it can be related to the undine's elemental heritage, as is often the case with brinesoul undines, who usually descend from brine dragons. Mistsoul undines might have a distant but powerful connection to elemental water, or might even have a bit of elemental air mixed into their ancestry.",

								"With all the same diversity in height, body type, and physical characteristics as any other member of their ancestries, undine coloration runs a vast breadth of variation. Most commonly, an undine's skin and hair mimic the colors of the lakes, seas, or oceans near where they were born, ranging from the palest of blues to sea greens and navies. A rare few undines may even take on the bioluminescence of deep-sea fish, the bright colors of corals and anemones, or the pale bone hues of seashells. More unusual traits can include fin-like ears, thin layers of shimmering fish scales covering their bodies, coral growths at their joints or temples, tails with caudal fins, and even webbed hands and feet."

							"entries": [
								"Unlike other geniekin, undines create and congregate within their own tightly knit communities near water or floating on top of it. Undine neighborhoods that develop within larger cities, typically near the docks or directly on the water, are informally known as flotillas. Because undines deliberately create and seek out these communities, their children usually have healthy childhoods focused on the values of fellowship and harmony. This stands in contrast to many other planar scions, who all-too-often grow up feeling like outsiders.",
								"Undines typically gravitate toward occupations that allow them to live and work near water, and many of them excel at fishing and sailing thanks to their love and understanding of the sea."

								"Religion isn't a major part of most undine's lives, but they often have strong spiritual connections to their supernatural ancestors or to water itself. Some undines worship deities of water, such as {@deity Gozreh} or {@deity Hei Feng}, while others might offer their prayers to {@deity Lysianassa}, the lost elemental lord of water."
