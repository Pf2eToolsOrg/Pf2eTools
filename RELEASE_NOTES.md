v0.8.5, "Stagnation" Edition

This update likely marks the end of PF2eTools in its current version, as the new remastered rules and lack of development combined make the book unconvertable.
 Typo fixes might still be pushed, but no new content or features.
A new version of the website is in the works, but we cannot promise when it will be out.
 For now however, enjoy Kineticist, you will need the filters for their 128 feats.
- Added the Kineticist Class, class feats, and backgrounds from Rage of Elements
- Added Gatewalkers 1 and 3
- (Typos/Tags)
